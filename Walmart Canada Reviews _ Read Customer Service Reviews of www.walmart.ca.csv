I ordered on October 6th for the 7th at 7-8am . It's 10;30 am and nothing. I called Walmart,  the door dash driver which seems he disconnected his cell. Door dash does not even call THEIR employees. Walmart said to wait till tomorrow morning to get refund. They are quick for payment but not for refunds. Walmart is a complete joke and so is doordash .",2024-10-07

This is totally unacceptable because it should be $5.95 for all don`t know what the other items will cost me in shipping I think i overpaid them approx. $ 30.00 on my credit card.

https://ca.trustpilot.com/users/67040a868a97fc57ef4391c6,1,Don't order heavy items from Walmart,"Don't order heavy items from Walmart on-line!

Walmart supplies a ""delivery"" service that drops items off at your garage or front door. So if your ordering a deep freezer they don't bring it inside. It is apparently a ""policy"" that they do not supply a delivery to inside your house for ""your protection"". So you can hurt yourself trying to move a heavy item!

Also because of the level of delivery they supply you can't see who is the final mile carrier or when your item will arrive. Thus you can just arrive home to find a deep freezer in from of your garage door or front door. You can see cross country carrier, but not who they hand the item off to for final delivery.

There is nothing on-line to describe the type of delivery that Walmart is providing, so that you would be aware of this before you place your order.

They should stop sell large heavy items on-line until they set up a proper delivery system like Costco or Home Depot.",2024-09-26
https://ca.trustpilot.com/users/60091fc06d10d9001a618655,1,"money taken, order never shipped","I ordered from their website and made sure I was ordering from Walmart directly and not a third party vendor. Turns out Walmart is lying and is ordering from a 3rd party, putting it in a Walmart box and shipping it as if it’s shipped and sold by them. I placed an order 6 days ago and no moment has been made nor any communication. When I called to ask, they told me to wait 72 business hours for a response back. Customer service is useless and all I could hear on the phone was scooter honking in the background.

I managed to get the CS rep to admit the order was delayed but then they quickly retracted when I asked why there was no communication to me about the delay. The item I ordered was $400 and I feel scammed at this point.

I live on an island, and base my purchases off the dates shown for delivery. I met my end of the deal, which was paying the bill, now it’s your turn to follow through. I am disgusted at Walmarts customer service practices and am now at the point of never stepping foot in any of there stores again.",2024-10-03

I needed help from a customer service associate, I raised my hand trying to get someone's attention as every associate was talking to each other and paying no attention to customers, and when an associate saw me she approached me in an aggressive manner and her behaviour was so low level you could even feel the rudeness and unprofessionalism. She was so rude, inconsiderate and unprofessional. Some associates are given the opportunity to work but unfortunately they abuse the system and do whatever they want. Please supervise !!!

My grocery items were checked out at a cash register , served by a polite cashier by the name Ashna. I am grateful for these 2 well trained employees, I recommend to anyone Walmart located in Capilano/50 st. to find groceries, fruits, clothing, electronics , everything you need in one location. I'm a resident of Edmonton. My name is Nellie.

https://ca.trustpilot.com/users/67040274554347572aa772ce,1,The worst customer service experience ,"If I could give this customer service minus 5 stars I would! The absolute worse customer service I have ever come across! I ordered a TV on the 26th September and it said it would be here on the 27th, I then received a message saying it was delayed until the 28th which I appreciated. By the 30th September I still had no TV so I phoned Walmart and explained the situation and they said the escalation team would be in touch, the escalation team phoned on the 1st October and said they were looking into it but had no further update! On the 3rd of October I phoned Walmart again and they stated I had to wait for the escalation team to get in touch! We ended up phoning looking to speak to a supervisor and she did not help either! She stated we would be compensated but we still have not got our refund so at this rate I’m not even sure we will be compensated for this awful experience. On the 4th of October Fed Ex phoned and said the order was lost and that Walmart have to refund me my money for the TV as it was no where to be found. I phoned Walmart straight away to explain that I was speaking to fed ex and that they must issue the refund, again I got told that the escalation team would be in touch! It is now the 7th of October and no one from the escalation team has been in contact! When I asked customer service for the refund they said they are not authorised to do it, I then asked for a direct number for the escalation team and they said there is no number for customers to contact! I asked for an email address for Walmart to send in a complaint, I was told there was no email address to send in a complaint! I hate hate hate leaving bad reviews but I feel I have been left with no options as their customer services is appalling, I now have no TV and I am down money and it just seems they are dragging their feet on refunding me back my money! Walmart is a multibillion company, the least I would expect would be good customer service! ",2024-10-06

I put the SD card on my camera and it was not reading. I returned the SD card to Walmart the morning of September 22. Literally less than 24 hours later and they informed me they cannot accept opened electronic devices. I wonder what kind of policy this is! I asked for the manager and asked her How do I get to know something is working unless I open it? After going back and forth with the supervisor because the manager had to rush for a meeting, I finally got approval for an exchange. Stay away from buying any electronics from Walmart because once you open it, as the manager and associates informed me, Walmart does not accept returns on opened electronics. So even if you buy something and it’s defective, once you open that box, the loss is on you. If you care about your time and money stay away from their electronic products.  The walmart I am talking about is 1045 Wellington Road London On. ",2024-09-21

The so called customer service people don't speak or understand simple English. Staff in the store chat out loud to each other in their own language and when asked to help, they, for the most part, couldn't understand what I needed and didn't as much as try. I looked all through the store, looking for someone who could understand me and found one!
Is this not racist of the Indian manager? Most friends of mine are now former WalMart customers.
I believe in all races but this is an obvious prejudice

Customer service told me it was a final sale and no returns permitted to which I responded I wasn't asking to return but for a refund since the product was damaged, unusable and going in the garbage.  Was told this was their policy.  So in essence the customer is liable for any potental damage that may occur during the shipping process. The agent didn't even ask whether replacements could be sent. I'm disgusted that I have to pay for product that was delivered damaged through no fault of my own.  And what poor customer service! Shame, shame on you Walmart!",2024-09-09

It's hard to keep track of what they charge you on the tiny screen and what you bag. I have come home several times with less items in my shopping bags after paying for it or noticing after the fact that I was charged for a different item than what I bought or sometimes even charged twice. I obviously don't want to go back to Walmart to complain about that just for a few items and I had to take my losses. So, PLEASE train your staff to bag groceries for clients so that we can see what the cashier charges us, especially when you're buying a lot of items and spending over $200 in grocieries.",2024-09-04

When he used it in store they said there was no money on it. So we called the number on the back of the card they said they couldn't help us and gave us another number.  So we called that number they could not help us and asked us to go into the store where we bought it. The manager couldn't help us either he called head office up and couldn't help us. The manager printed out the transaction of where the card was used and it was used the next day . Like how can that be possible when we gave ot to my brother a week later. It's so obvious that the gift card was fraud.  Gift cards should be sold behind the counter. I've heard of many stories similar to ours. Never ever buying gift cards again.  So disappointed in Walmart for not helping us. The manager was helpful but could not do anything a manager should have the authority to help with situations like this,2024-07-08

It also says it isn’t eligible for a return but I read the return policy very carefully and it should be. Additionally, today I received an order I made for disposable gloves. They sell 100/$10 at the store but never have medium in stock so I ordered online.

Another time, I called because I forgot to state that I didn't want any substitutions in my order. I ended up being on hold for almost 45 minutes, only to be told that they couldn't get in touch with the courier. They told me that if I get substitutions, I should call back and I'll be refunded for them. Like, what? Every time I order fruits and vegetables, they're always rotten.

My point is, don't waste your time calling their support.

Feedback:

I recently made a purchase, and shortly after, I noticed that the price of the item had dropped by 20%. I contacted customer service to request a price match, but was instead instructed to return the item and repurchase it at the new price. This process is highly inconvenient and frustrating, especially for a loyal customer. It's disappointing that Walmart Canada doesn't offer a straightforward price adjustment policy.

Got an email this morning....guess they have no stock but the item is being shipped from a warehouse via FedEx to the store I chose. Why couldn't the original store do that?

Logging on is a long involved process where you must click in each box instead of the cursor being pre-propigated. Seems a small thing but no other competing website has this annoyance. then you have to wait for your cookie preferances to load, another minute or so of waiting (I browse in private so must load this screen every time and wait every time) Then once in to the site to log on to your account another series of screens that you have to wait for and then the last screen, the confirmation code where they send a 6 digit code to your messages, that sometimes takes more than 5 Minutes to send. This whole process EVERY time you log on to Walmart.ca. Now my only other complaint is if you buy groceries. At the end of the shopping process, sure there's a little, hidden away, option to opt out of having some staff member decide what would be a suitable replacement for what I have ordered. This option is not a bad option but it should not be the default it should be elective to have substitutions. Sure the option in there to opt out but it is very easy to miss and then you end up with a bunch of poor substitutions for what you wanted. If I ordered Boston Cream Donuts, a pack of stale (and when I say stale I mean hard to cut with a sharp bread knife) doughnuts is not a suitable substitution.
So, overall the website is good. I personally hate the reseller thing but generally service has been good. Refunds too have been good when I've bothered to request one. Overall mostly Walmart.ca is very acceptable except for the really poor website logon process and the default setting for substitutions.",2024-07-12

I placed an order on Friday evening on July 12, 2024 with delivery scheduled for today Sunday July 14, 2024.

The item was out for delivery 8:30 am this morning and it still wasn't delivered to my condo building by 4:30 pm on Sunday July 14th!

So I check the online tracker and at 4:07 pm it says that an EXCEPTION occurred. Of course there is no explanation of exactly what this means, so I had to call Walmart to find out what this means!
I get told that the courier supposedly attempted to deliver my item at that time but was unable to do so. We have a 24/7 concierge on duty so if the concierge was momentarily away, the courier could have waited several minutes. Walmart has my cell # on file so the courier should have had access to it so he could call me. I received no such call at all from the courier.

Walmart could care less if I get my order on time or not! All they care about is the bottom line! They don't give a crap about the customer and that is very evident!

I will be calling my credit card provider when the order is posted to my credit card statement and I will dispute the charge to get my money back!

If I could give Walmart Canada a -10 out if 10 rating, I would indeed do so!

Quite focusing on the bottom line and focus 100% on the customer!
FIRE THESE BOTTOM FEEDER COURIER COMPANIES AND HIRE REPUTABLE COURIER COMPANIES!

Fedex apparently lost the second item and I am now dealing with them to track it. Items three and four arrived a few days later, delivered by UPS. The fifth item is still not here although it was to be delivered today...Walmart site now says tomorrow. It has been a few years since I ordered via Walmart online and once I sort this mess out, I will never order from them again.

Went in with my dad to buy something, and told him they'd likely have the product and we could still get it, because of the long hours. We arrived to happily see the box on the shelf, but went to pick it up and it was empty.

Asked a worker on the floor if they could look to see how many there were supposed to be, and they kindly explained to me what could've happened, only good part of my visit.

Once I made it up to customer service to see if they'd help with this odd occurrence, that's when all care and respect went out the door. They called the D.U.T.Y. manager.

As a final note, if this happens to you, ask for the R.E.A.L. manager, because only someone really evil and lazy does not help the customer. And if they weren't going to help, I would've liked to know that before I left.

Seller refused to refund since it was on clearance and refused return since it was technically the correct item and nothing was wrong with it so in his mind it counted as ""seller changing mind""

2) pre ordered item meant to arrive on launch date...still didn't get it a month after launch. went back and forth with customer service multiple times and spoke to several higher ups to finally determine it got lost in the mail and they'd send a new one...not only did they CHARGE me a 2nd time...but they never actually sent it...took another month of near daily contact to finally get refunded for both charge and just picked the item up in store (they honoured the sale price of the pre order)

3) was 2$ short on a ""spend X, get X$ off"" deal so threw in a small item. still got the discount but they forgot to send the extra item and even after showing the receipt, they refused to send a new one because ""it was too inexpensive an item to warrant the cost of shipping so they would lose money""...

4) contacted customer service after waiting 2 weeks past the delivery date only to find it had actually delivered in store on time and the tracking was never updated...had to wait about an hour in store for warehouse to find it

5) CURRENTLY dealing with this one... was sent the wrong item. WM refused to refund the cost of shipping since it was 3rd party. seller is being uncooperative claiming he doesn't owe me shipping as i never paid it....i literally have the reciept and customer service can see it my account is clearly says ""shipping 9.95""... so either seller it outright lying, or they are confused and think its referring to return shipping...either way, its now been 5 days and seller hasn't responded so i'm dealing with WM customer service who insists they cant refund as they are just the middle man but the can ""excelate"" it (what ever that means. but doesnt give me hope as they also ""escalated"" my 2nd issue listed above and did nothing)

I said OK and just want the battery xchange money back. The manger said NO and told the young man at the department ""Not do anything for him"" - ended no refund (so sad). When being asked, the employee - the poor young guy- kept saying ""she is the manager"" - again and again. That's Walmart North London.

went Walmart Wellington, no issues.

I was told: ""It will arrive on time"" , ""Nothing is wrong with the order"", ""The order was confirmed by the warehouse and will arrive on time"" , ""It will be shipped soon"". They couldn't tell me where the warehouse was located, what carrier they were using, nothing at all. On Nov 29, they escalated the issue. Sure enough, the item never arrived and I received a 'Delayed item"" email on Nov 30. On Dec 01, when I went to check the order status, it was cancelled. No cancellation email was sent, no reason for cancellation and no response from the so called 'escalation team'.

Walmart needs to monitor marketplace sellers & respond to the customers when they have been received like that.

I ordered 2 photobooks (orders were placed on 2 separate dates). I got the notifications from FedEx and WalMart stating my order was delivered and ready for pickup before 3pm on a Friday.
I went to pick up my order on Friday after 4pm and the order was no where to be found. One of the employees was going to call me the next day (Saturday) with an update however no one did.
I returned to WalMart around 7:30pm on Saturday and asked again. The sales girl told me ""Yeah, I had 5 people come in today and their orders aren't here.... I've seen about 20 people now never receive their order..."". Then I was told that a third party who is hired by WalMart accepts orders and they don't work weekends... why would my orders say ""Ready for Pickup"" before the weekend?
I called WalMart Photo customer service as I was leaving the store, and because the person on the phone couldn't get a hold of anyone in WalMart they couldn't do anything about it.
I called again the following Monday, and again the man I spoke to could not get a hold of anyone in WalMart, ""They aren't answering their phones. I suggest you keep calling us back until we can get a hold of this store by phone"".
I'm out almost $60, no one knows where my orders are and I have proof they were delivered by FedEx (you are able to download proof of delivery). And now I just have to keep calling and hoping for the best?
This customer service doesn't even deserve 1 star, it deserves 0 for their lack of organization, lack of being able to hep a customer (or more of a lack of wanting to help). Instead of telling me to keep calling them, why couldn't the customer service agent take my information and try again and call me back? Or keep trying while I was on the phone with them?

When he arrived he asked if both orders were ready and he was told that they were and he drove away with what he believed were both. One home, we quickly figured out that only 1 order was in the car.

When I got a hold of the store, they said something like, 'oops, sorry, yes the other order is still here. Can you come back and get it?' Which I could not do as I no longer had a car. They refused to send a driver out to me and offered to refund it. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told there were none on duty ???? and to call back later. I did call back and was told they were all in meetings.

The next day I called 3 times and was unable to get a supervisor as NO ONE picked up in online grocery. Finally I initiated a refund myself and thought that would be the end of it...but nope. The store had entered into their system that we had picked up BOTH orders when we had not, so they won't refund the full cost of the items.

As soon as I drove in to the parking lot I was greeted with Homeless asking all vehicle drivers for money etc., all the cart corrals were full, there was garbage everywhere.
Now inside store these ""NEW CANADIANS"" lmao staring at my 14 year old daughter and myself like we were wanted criminals; rats running everywhere even between your feet, on the food shelves you see them scurry away almost all boxes on shelves have very clear evidence of rat chewing or mice chewing. Rat and mice feces on all shelves and stains from I assume urine stains from critters, I wanted a loaf of bread and had gone through 7 loaves before I found one not chewed or eaten by rats.
None of the shelves were properly stocked and if they were it was without care or concern like for example only Jam spreads were in the pasta isle and peanut butter was in the canned soup isle; it was very confusing to find the things I needed that wasn't chewed by rats or somewhere completely oddly placed.
Now I've got what I could find (still needed another store cause shelves not stocked proper or what was left chewed by rats); daughter and I walked to cash to check out, I was walked into by and older woman wearing completely see trough negligee ( so see through you count the bumps on her areolas or count her pubic hairs ) she might as well have come in totally nude, thats when I was shocked by two more disturbing things I didn't let my daughter see, on older man in only a robe which he had concern fell open ( he was completely nude underneath) and then another isle looked two mid 3os guys openly masturbating each other, I talked some broken English staff about these incidents and they did nothing.
At cash cause I want to leave at this point, the cash attendant in her traditional attire spoke no English and her attire was also very see through, as she was also picking her nose and helping people on cashes, not washed or sanitized hands.
Now going out the door my purchases were checked in accordance to receipt (fine), as I was leaving anyway something got said to us loudly enough when looked up after I was told to F*** O**.
So in opinion I'm never going back to that store and I've put up several reviews in lots of places to tell people to not step foot in there ever. Our friends included who all agree with me.

Then second and third time too many items missing yet were paid for I had to go over each item again and again with their customer service to get money back to card. I quit them for some time . Thought try again first ok a few items missing got money taken off bill then same deal all over again. Thirty three items missing is the worst with only 2 perfect orders ever.  I saw online two women out hundreds of dollars with Walmart gift cards when they tried to check value online they were useless maybe switched on the tree.  No recourse for them through Walmart. I called local Walmart asked about this was told no problems with this card here. Previously I had used prepaid Visa or MasterCard to pay for my food it didn't matter when I got to Walmart.ca checkout online no funds on card left or all gone bogus charges. Last before Walmart card took me 4 months to get $200 prepaid MasterCard back. I called their customer service this is for food! Same rote response full out the forms well they don't care if you eat or not this is the way they drag their feet and resubmissions etc etc. What I'd this was all the money I had left!  They don't care they need their jobs.  I am a senior have arthritis can't do the big shopping jaunts anymore.  Ordered 72 items with my $200 Walmart gift card used it almost to the dollar get brother who lives here as usual pickup groceries bring home as usual 1/3 gone.  This is Christmas 3 days before no trimmings for the dinner no veggies gravy seasonings cranberry sauce squat.  It came to 18 items missing I could only verify 15 on website copied product code from one produce item got tools or t-shirts??? A mistake .  Went over items with call to customer service at least 5 times in two calls whine over the three items  that was already purchased and tallied.  They took $32 off when my Talley was about $62 for the 18 items. They have been there with me several times before and they charged me an extra $4.20 for expedited pickup that I didn't request. I had to pay one of their competitors twice as much to fill out my grocery order for my dinner.  Now it's later in Jan 2024 and I have made two calls to their card  menu explain again Supervisor to call me back and an email nothing. I told her to let her supervisor listen to the quality control. Do the math you don't need to do this for non food items just use website. Food is a big ripoff item  guy brings food and puts it brother's truck he comes homes.  I always print up my bill.  This time I saved all pages easier for me then when I went to verify items again  said page not available or down same as before.  But I did print bill out with store city amount date and a couple dozen tiny picture. Asked local Walmart  manager if I could   fax so I could bypass customer service  she never saw a fax in the office I asked if I could email can't do that either. I am owed about $64 maybe more by Walmart.ca for those groceries not $32 there is a big discrepancy in the amount owing. Somebody has been stealing both my money and time and my food. I suggested strongly that an extra 5 or ten minutes per pickup be taken to assess and rescan the items with a printout receipt from their end. Extra ten minutes how long have I spent on the phone? No a egift card nothing no call from supervisor. Longer they have your money it can be used.,2023-12-22

Woke up today to another cancelled item, no explanation. refund to my bank card but no refund for my gift card. so its going to be another week wait at least. I'm so over it I've been stressing over this stupid phone for over a week. Now I get to go to work with no phone and a new born at home since walmart had this ""great online sale"" that I wont even get to use since they wont honor the original sale nor do I want to. when ever I get this refund back I will be selling it and taking the $60 hit because I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH I do not want to deal with this head ache and sad excuse of a reputable company again. hopefully some people take this review to heart and i save them the time and hassle. NEVER AGAIN! Walmart should be ashamed of themselves.

**update: I got my refund 8 days and 2 escalations later. I feel like if I hadn't bugged and bugged, emailed corporate it wouldn't have got done for a long time. I will change my rating when and if I receive my phone, I'm still skeptical after this whole experience.**

If i could write down -1000000 best believe i would and looking at these comments everybody is experiencing similar problems. Customer service is a joke. They place me on hold and just kept me there. They've owed me almost $400 for the past week. Its all games when you call, just the run around. They dont give any proper information out. They dont tell you if you use a walmart gift card on the walmart website, to use at least 1 cent of another patment method or it will cancel. I order a phone and the next day i wake up to a refund in the form of another gift card, no explanation. I reorder the phone with the gift card the sent me back because i wasnt trying to miss the sale. This one just gets cancelled nothing about a refund. I call and they say they are giving me my refund. They dont send anything about the gift card yet. They actually send me an email telling me to use the same payment method and everything which would of screwed me over again if they had actually refunded me. They dont say anything about the gift card until the third time i call, then they tell me that i cant use just a gift card online. They say thats the reason why i cant get my refund right away because of their error, with their gift card, on their website. Theres a second sale on and the phone i should already have is $40 more. The way things are going now they are just going to hold it off until the sale is done and ill be stuck with a useless gift card to a useless company. I really regret not getting a cheaper phone from amazon or even paying 100 more for the same phone. At least i would have it and customer service gets stuff done if need be which ive never really needed. Walmart is supposed to be a reputable company but they are jokes.

My last order cost almost 20.00 to deliver. On the phone, one agent told me to call back once the items were delivered for the 9.97 to be refunded, and when I did the next agent told me too bad and went back on what the original agent had said. I canceled DeliveryPass to get THAT money back instead, and he wouldn't refund it for at least a week.
Also, they are always out of stock of everything important. I am sick and ordered Buckley's, which is available on the site, but then was told it was sold out. I asked that it be substituted or cancel the order, and they said there was NOTHING to substitute (didn't even check since it took 30 seconds!) and wasted so much time in the chat (disconnected twice so you have to start over multiple times) that the order I wanted to cancel went out anyway.
I ended up paying double delivery fee (9.97 + DeliveryPass fee) for a tiny order that I didn't even want because it was just supposed to be a couple extra things attached to the IMPORTANT thing (the medicine) because they waffle around in chat and on the phone for so long but don't really want to help you at all.
Scam and terrible customer service. I guess that is the norm nowadays!!!
If I had tried to order medicine from the tiny drugstore locally, it would have cost a couple dollars more but cheaper shipping and would already have been delivered. If it wasn't in stock he would have either substituted or I could have canceled within a minute. I'll do that from now on since I don't trust Walmart at all now!
Especially after buying all my groceries through them for years and years that is the treatment I got is SCAMMED and manipulated so they didn't have to cancel or refund THEIR mistakes!

The first time was in mid-2019, and I ordered bedding. It came stained, I could clearly see it because I ordered a white comforter and you could see it through the packaging. I had a horrible time at their customer service, the lady in charge told me that the barcode did not match the online item reference code, she kept scanning it even though clearly, the unopened product looked identical to the picture she had on her screen. Stupidly enough, she kept asking me whether I bought the item at Walmart, I showed her my online account, receipts, e-mails, etc. She still insisted that it ""needed to be checked"". She went back and forth with her manager for nearly 20 minutes, and during this entire time, we held up a queue of like 10 other people. This experience led me to avoid Walmart at all costs.

https://ca.trustpilot.com/users/631bdbd3dbf1b10012af02ca,1,Not acceptable service for 2023.,"Hello consumers.  We ordered a coffee table from Walmart at the beginning of July, to complete our living room.  It did not arrive.  Weeks later it still hadn't come (and still hasn't come).   We filed a complaint with Walmart which in their email said they have launched an inquiry in their own words to the whereabouts of this item.  The next day, they said they needed two or three more days to inquire as to what is going on.  The two or three days came and went.  I filed another complaint and received the same two or three-day inquiry process letter, which came and went.  We looked into the whereabouts ourselves and found that the item has been stuck in the same state for 18 days plus.  I called to cancel, and Walmart said that I can't cancel as they said they are in the middle of their inquiry process which is going nowhere, as I continue to get the same letter of inquiry that says they are in the process -- 3 times now.I realize that not everyone can be Amazon, where the product is delivered to your home, while you are basically still on the phone orders, however, this level of service is not acceptable in 2023.  we are getting close to a month paid without a product and the product cannot be found and they are telling me I can't cancel.Constructively, Walmart needs to understand that unless customers are paying for the product after it arrives, rather than before, Walmart must take on the responsibility of legally delivering the product as quickly and as efficiently as possible.  Specifically, they need to have their own guidelines.  Successful Canadian businesses like Tim Hortons, as an example only, have a clock that runs for each customer, to determine if any customer waited too long for their order.  Walmart needs to set its own standards of so many days/hours etc. and have its own employees own their responsibility to make sure these deliveries happen within this agreed time period.  Infinity is not an acceptable arrival time, sorry.",2023-07-24

Ordered a lawnmower online for store pickup as i needed it the next day to finish my lawn as the landlord was coming over. I was informed it would be ready the next day. As my husband was driving to pick up the lawnmower i was informed it would not be available for pick up for 10 days!!!?
If I would have ordered delivery i would have had it in 5 days.
When i called they said there was nothing they could do. I said either refund my money or get me a lawnmower by the following morning. I said you enteted a contract with me where i agreed to give you money if you agreed to supply me with a oriduct the next day. So, i gave them money, they did not give me a priduct, yet still took my money knowing they didnt have it. That is pretty greasy, if another person did this to me it would be considered theft.
I would never again use their online anything...I will be returning the item the minute they give it to me.
They will most likely not see me spending any money in their stores anymore either.
Keep safe.
Oh yes, and when I asked to speak to a manager about returning my money, i was sent to a dead line that just kept ringing. Guaranteed they were informed to do that. Very classy🙄",2023-06-30

So I began looking online to see if there were any available in a short period of time? No body seemed to have any that would come earlier than about 10-14 days! Then I came upon one on Walmart.ca and the delivery information CLEARLY stated: “Shipping, arrives BY Tuesday, May 16, 2023” Now this is NOT just an estimated delivery date but RATHER it IS stating that it WILL arrive by THAT day! So now foolishly TRUSTING that Walmart was telling me the “TRUTH” I clicked on “PLACE YOUR ORDER” and boy was that ever a MISTAKE! But now AGAIN on the next screen that you are taken to has a big “THANK YOU FOR YOUR ORDER!” with a big green check mark and now it has an order number as well as the total price including tax and yet AGAIN for shipping/delivery it CLEARLY states: “Shipping, arrives BY Tuesday, May 16, 2023” Now it feels so
good to know that in JUST a FEW days I’ll have my new air conditioner and all will be cool and well! Now two days go by and on Monday, May 15, 2023 there is an email from Walmart but NOW it’s stating: “ESTIMATED delivery, Tuesday, May 16, 2023” Well people this is how they ENSNARE you into buying an item telling you one thing “Arrives BY” and now it’s “ESTIMATED” which ARE two totally DIFFERENT statements! So I’m calling customer service right away to find out the “TRUTH!” and they don’t have a clue about ANYTHING! The gal tells me to wait until the following day which was the 16th and so I did! Well the next day arrives which IS the 16th the day my order was to “Arrive BY!” and now they’re telling me that order is now “DELAYED” and the now estimate for delivery is “MONDAY, MAY 29TH!” Are you kidding right now! First they state CLEARLY (Twice) a day that the order WILL “arrive BY” and now it’s a FULL two weeks past when they said it WOULD arrive BY! So now I say cancel my order that’s too long to wait for me! Now by rights if they can’t deliver in a timely manner especially when they said it would “ARRIVE BY!” but NOT at Walmart.ca where if you don’t cancel the order within a “PATHETIC” and so “RIDICULOUS” 30 minute window after placing your order then you can NOT cancel! But rather you will HAVE 2 wait until the item finally does arrive and then MOST inconveniently bring back to the store for a refund! Now correct me if I’m wrong but the way that I see it is 1) They “LIE” TWICE to convince you the order is just a few days away so you won’t even think about any kind of cancellation! 2) Now TWO days later AFTER the HORRIBLE “30 MINUTE!” cancellation window they tell the truth and it’s now an “ESTIMATED” delivery time and NOT “Arrives BY!” So what it is is they lie to get your $$$ then after they’ve got it and the half hour window is gone they lay it on you with the truth about delivery! This is a DESPICABLE business practice where they trick into to buying with FALSE delivery dates and then when after 30 minutes when you can NOT cancel they pretty much “HOLD YOU HOSTAGE!” I will NEVER set foot in Walmart “ANYWHERE!” on this ENTIRE planet or use their AWFUL online website EVER again!!!

On both Thursday and Friday the tracking said the package was delayed. All of a sudden I receive an email at 10:10pm saying the package was delivered on Friday night. The driver claimed to have the package ""out for delivery"" at 9:55pm, ""on the move"" at 9:55pm, and ""delivered"" at 9:56pm. Clearly this is not possible. I had my condo security check the cameras and a delivery agent did not come to the condo at all between 9:30pm and 10:20pm.

I called customer service and they told me it would take up to 48 hours to investigate. I made it clear my daughter needs her formula before then but of course, they could not do anything else.

I received an email today stating that I should check with other residents of my home. I live alone with my five month old daughter so there is no one that could have collected that package.

I then advised them again that prior to calling initially I checked my condos hallway and called security, asking them if there was anything delivered for me. When they confirmed there had not been anything delivered I then had them check the cameras from 9:30pm to 10:20pm. At 10:23pm I called customer service to report the undelivered package. The driver never came here. The representative then processed a refund because I have proof that the driver did not come here.

Started a chat session and was told that they have just taken an authorization and that they never charge anything prior to shipping the goods.
This was obviously wrong, so I gave the agent the transaction number , status from Paypal,Paypal invoice number etc... but the agent stupidly was telling me that Walmart didn't charge me for anything. I decided to call Walmart and talked to an agent that was telling me the same lies. Then I offered him to send him proofs of what I was telling him .....

I requested a cancellation and after some interaction ... he put me on hold and then told me that indeed cancelling the order should address all issues... Then when he cancelled the order , the refund from Paypal was automatically generated a couple of minutes later. When I told him that the refund is on its way , he saw nothing on his side, like if the Walmart system didn't have any trace of them cashing in and refunding me ..... Imagine that !

On the first visit I purchased 2  2 litres of milk and took them home. The best before dates were fine but both milk items were sour.  They were obviously left out of the refrigerator too long. Today Jan 19 I purchased some cheese and when I got it to the checkout I noticed that the cheese was really mouldy. One of the comments I read earlier stated that Walmart has gone down hill since Covid and would agree with that. I no longer have confidence in Walmart and will no longer buy food from Walmart. If they let cheese and milk rot then I’d hate to try their meats.,2023-01-19

I wanted to compare salad sizes & prices, but some salads didn't even show how much the package weighed, or even it's dimensions -- ZERO size info -- so I scrolled to the ""Specifications"" section... but NO weight details there, either.

He should come back soon - but he never came. Next day again costumer service. We should start a refund. We did - declined. We called again. It was said, if the refund is higher 100$ it is automatically cancelled (very funny, why was it suggested then?). He promised to escalate this to another person. But still there is no refund by mid-January. The biggest problem is imho that you don't have the possibility of contacting the driver (other than in Instacart or Real Canadian, where you have a name and number).

1- 90% of the time, you will get a soon date of delivery, then magically the date will change to ""Delayed"". No matter what you do, they will not give you a date. This is embarrassing.
2- Chat and phone calls, they add artificial wait. Proof: If you wait on chat on your phone, the timer will not progress if you switch to another app:-) This wait is not because the agents are busy. It is simply to deter you from calling or starting a chat. What a way to treat customers.
3- I tried cancelling an order. I cannot. They said I can only cancel an order within 30 minutes (yes that is half hour) from the time I ordered it. After that, even if it is delayed 1 month, I still have to wait, pick it up, the return it to a store or send it back before I get my money.
4- Never, ever buy anything important from Walmart. You will wait longer than you think. If you are replacing a broken item at your home, prepare for a disappointment.
5- When I lost my patience and went to the store to ask if my item is there but they failed to email me, I was told a number of emails were sent to the wrong customers! And they started looking for my itm in the store:-) Imagine Walmart are sending details of your order and probably more in an email to a complete stranger.",2022-12-11

After responding that if that was the only option, they should refund me immediately. The same day I went back on the website and the product was showing as still available to order on line at a price of $10,000 (clearly an error) and the delivery time was suspiciously the exact amount of time it was to take my previous order which tells me it is not back ordered, I think it was just easier for them to refund me rather than send another with rushed delivery in time for Christmas.

When my Wife & Daughter returned to Walmart approximately 1 ½ hours later a refund or exchange was refused.

The Customer Service desk's reasoning was ""she should have known the package was empty by the weight"" with my Daughter Never buying this product previously how could she possibly know what the package should weigh? The Employee that handled the package at check out didn't even know or I suspect they would noy have let her pay.

After promises of being a valuable customer, no worry - I would receive my item, compensation, we will look after you... my item/order was eventually just cancelled/refunded and I was told they would offer no customer satisfaction or compensation because it was a Walmart Marketplace order placed on walmart.ca and the walmart.ca customer service team can do nothing to help you as told to me by superviser, Mukesh Sharma. This came after bringing to their attention on three separate occasions that there was no shipping/tracking information. Three times I was told they would escalate the issue and to wait three business days and the escalation team would contact me. They never did. I was told it would arrive by Oct.31st, then Nov. 6th, then when I called Nov.9th I was told I would have it Nov. 10th and to wait. Then I was told again it needed to be escalated. Again no call back. I called again Nov. 19th and it was escalated again and to wait 3 days but I was told a supervisor would contact me within 24hrs as a courtesy even though I did not request it. They did not. But on the 22nd I received a call and told they would help me out and it would be resolved to my satisfaction on the 23rd and the escalation team would contact me. Well, they did call, just refunded me and said good day and they were unable to offer any compensation, I had to call a supervisor.

This seemed reasonable, considering it was due to negligence on behalf of the seller. Then, a day later, I got another customer service agent who stated that the first agent was wrong, and I had to bring the item to a Walmart store; even though the seller was at fault, I was the one being inconvenienced. The whole purpose of my ordering online was so that I didn't have to go to a store. I asked to speak to a supervisor. I was put on hold twice. No supervisor was available.

One of the items was a Extreme Steam iron 005087582816 (on invoice) for $64.98.I returned the iron for exchange or refund on September 1,2022 as it was not meeting my standards, only to be told by the CSM that the SKU on the box is not in there system. I am extremely puzzled since I have no other iron at home and have purchased no other iron anywhere. They told me they cannot assist me as the SKU on the box is 6845918007 0 is not in the system. I was at pains to explain that there is not a chance of this getting mixed up from my end.
Right now I am feeling totally cheated and will be returning everything on that invoice.

Didn't realize this was a third vendor purchase.  Not very clear on website.  #2.  Walmart has 90 day return policy.

https://ca.trustpilot.com/users/63025a701bb0fa001271313a,1,"Missing deliveries, non-helpful support line and terrible substitutions","The drivers always mark the shipment as delivered before it’s been delivered so that it looks like they’ve delivered within the right timeframe. Which isn’t that big of a deal unless it’s late at night. HOWEVER, twice now I haven’t even received the products. The first time I received a refund but this time they required that I file a police report of the incident because the order was marked as delivered they’re saying that the products must have been stolen from my property. But there was no truck that even arrived. I filed the police report and gave them the information that they requested but they’re still not giving my money back. Costumer service just repeats phrases and isn’t helpful at all. Another annoying aspect is that something went wrong in the app so that instead of 2 jugs of milk (that I ordered) they were sending 10!! In addition to 8 extra frozen pizzas and two childrens vitamins. So in the end they made two withdrawals from my account for over 500 dollars (!!) instead of the original order of 300 dollars. That is a large amount of money to lose for a family with two small children.

Other than this, previous issues have been getting a small fraction of the products that I ordered without telling me beforehand. For example I once received 27 out of 81 items which they didn’t notify me until it was already out for delivery. Honestly if there’s so much missing there’s no point in paying for delivery because I had to go to the store anyway to purchase the rest of my order.

Substitutions are also sometimes a joke: they substitute coke for sparkling water or subs for hot dog buns. A substitution should be for the same product but a different brand, not a completely different product all together.

So, in conclusion, I don’t recommend grocery shopping from Walmart, I will personally be going elsewhere with all of my future orders and will recommend everyone that I know to do the same.",2022-08-21
https://ca.trustpilot.com/users/62ff903175b1200012e31be5,1,app glitch causing a 10 day hold on my funds with no product.,"This is regarding an online grocery pick up order.
I placed an order for a pick up on August 5th through the Walmart app, once placing the order, the app crashed but the money was taken from my account so I assumed this meant my order went through. Within 2 hours of my pick up time, I phone the store to inquire about my order as I had yet to receive an order number. They informed me there was no order and advised me to place another one. I did so and paid for express pick up, only to have the same thing happen where my order was non existent but my money was gone. At this point, I was now out of just over $260 and no groceries. After over an hour on the phone with customer service, I still was out of my money with no groceries and told I’d be contacted in 3 business days by finance. Finance nor anyone from head office ever phoned me back, or even emailed and I waited until August 15/22 before my money was refunded. I am absolutely disgusted by the lack of customer care and support that was received. I am in no way considered a wealthy person and I have a family with a child to feed. I was put out of 2 weeks worth of grocery money for 10 days causing issues with being able to properly care for things in my household with little to no remorse from the company. Not to mention ZERO compensation for Walmart holding onto my $260 for 10 days. It is sickening that we were made to wait this long for that amount of money from a computer glitch and then to be ignored and not contacted back. I know it does not matter that we are one family Walmart is losing business from, but I really hope this situation never happens to anyone else who shops there as it could mean the difference of families being fed or not for some people. This was an absolutely horrendous situation, I should not have been penalized for a technical error on Walmarts end, yet I was the one who had to suffer. I also contacted Walmart Canada on Twitter after this happened and did not seem to be taken seriously as they stopped responding after mentioning I was only making a complaint.

I know Walmart has low prices that fit into people budgets better but if you can shop elsewhere, then do so. There are other companies who care about their employees and customers that deserve your money more.",2022-08-19

Found an older $20 gift card from many Christmases ago that I had put away and forgotten.  Checked online and it says gift cards do not expire but as it did not have a pin number I would have to go to customer service to exchange it for a newer one.  After standing in line for about 15 minutes the customer service person could not find it in the system (probably as it was so old).  The customer service manager suggested that someone might have stolen the card before it was given to me and they couldn't give me another one?????  Needless to say I flipped out at this suggestion.  For $20 they would prefer to lose business because they couldn't find it and then were rude about it.

Ordered groceries online since it's convenient. There were the usual substitutions which aren't surprising. But the delivery driver when he/she was 5 minutes away suddenly canceled the order. When I enquired with customer service they informed me that the driver tried to reach me multiple times and couldn't FIND THE ADDRESS. I have gotten my groceries delivered to my address (a condo in downtown toronto) and have never had this issue. After pressing the CS agent they finally admitted that the driver had messed up (they recently started using Instacart) and canceled the order.

When asking them to replace my order they refused and forced me to place an express delivery order since I needed the groceries at short notice. They refused to reimburse my express delivery fee even though it was their problem that they couldn't deliver that day.

After I bit the bullet and coughed up for the express delivery fee, the driver was 3 hours late for a 2 hour or less delivery. When enquiring with customer care, they could only promise that the groceries would be here shortly and that the 2 hour guarantee did not mean that express delivery fees would be reimbursed.

After all this when the driver finally arrives he dropped the groceries off outside the condo building UNATTENDED from where they were subsequently stolen. This callous driver had the gall to call me and tell me that the groceries were ""Somewhere downstairs"". He also apparently couldn't figure out how to come up to the unit and I had to go downstairs to collect it. This was a lie since the buzzer code had been provided and past drivers have never had an issue. In addition, Walmart policy clearly states that groceries should not be left with security or unattended which he clearly did not care about. The groceries were subsequently stolen and I was out of luck once again. It took several calls to customer care to convince them to refund me since they kept asking me to look around.",2022-07-11

My review is just as obvious as the title. I will never trust WALMART CANADA INC. for any online orders or additional fulfillments. I ordered a gold PS4 duel shock controller for my son. When I purchased the controller from the Walmart website, the product was advertised as a GENUINE PS product. We paid the full amount of $74 asking price. After about 6 months of usage, my sons controller started having stick drift issues. I knew my Walmart warranty expired and I proceeded to the one-year manufacturer warranty through PlayStation. I sent the controller in and they sent it back to me shortly after with a document attached to it stating ‘this product is NOT covered under warranty because the product is not a genuine PlayStation product/ is a third party product’. I called PlayStation to clarify my confusion because I was under the understanding I purchased a genuine PlayStation product via Walmart Canada online. When I confirmed the serial number with the playstation representative, he stated their serial numbers do not start with letters and I need to contact Walmart because this is just a third party peripheral. I contact Walmart Canada customer service and OMG! The service is horrible!! I was greeted by reps that couldn’t speak English and kept rudely cutting me off so they can continue to repeat their ‘script’ without fully listening to me and the situation. I escalated my case a couple of times to ‘supervisors’ who were constantly ‘too busy to answer right now’ and have yet to receive a proper call back for ANY resolutions. This isn’t the first time that WALMART CANADA INC. shipping has errored in orders. When I first ordered controllers for myself, I was sent size 6 boys clothes, instead of my controllers… after constant calls to find out where my controllers were and that I didn’t pay almost $200 for size 6 boys clothes, they reluctantly reimbursed me once I returned the clothes and I had to proceed to re-order. In summary, this company's customer service policy is an absolute circus act and pure jokes.

This is impossible and normally driver will call to let me know they are 15 mins out if not the bags are left on the porch. Security camera faces front of home. Only mail, prescription delivery, family but no Walmart drivers. At least 3 people are home all day and sometime siting on porch. Walmart said they have to cancel order. Walmart would have me believe that 3x drivers didn't call or knock, decided not to leave bags on porch? I find the driver excuse very disingenuous!

One order issue was when they replaced an unavailable item with an unsellable one when the option in my account was to refund me when the item I wanted wasn’t available. Who wants unscented laundry detergent as a replacement choice?

The last straw was when I ordered something to be delivered, it didn’t arrive at it scheduled time and I wasn’t notified. I had to go to my app to find out that my order was bungled and had to contact chat support. They told me I would be refund my delivery fee and it would arrive 7-8pm that night. Time passes and nothing arrive. I had to contact support again. They typed word for word everything the first support did including offering me a refund for my delivery. Obviously overseas chat with a script in hand.

Being low income I have suffered through using their service for a couple years now and the times they don't screw up an order are the exception not the norm.

For instance I am currently trying to fix the steaming pile of cow dung they have made out of my recent order. It was supposed to have arrived early yesterday evening but of course that never happened. I have made four calls to try and straighten things out. After one of them the call centre person told me oh sorry about the delay but they are enroute now. Several hours later it was clear he had lied to my face so I was forced to waste $35 on ordering pizza. So much for saving money. Thanks Walmart.ca. Anyway I called back. The next person on the line wanted to reschedule for the next evening. No thank you I had already wasted one entire night inside waiting so I asked him to cancel only to be told this was not an option. Finally I got frustrated and hung up. I phoned back today and again tried to cancel the order and close my account and was told cancellation is not an option despite the fact they had failed to meet their obligations. In effect they are holding my time, my money and my order hostage.

You would think a multi-billion dollar company could figure out how to get a simple grocery delivery right but it just doesn't happen. I suppose all that profit goes to their greedy management instead of getting the job done properly. And why do they never call and update people when this kind of nonsense occurs?

Chat or a phone number I did the live talk now its time to have my complaint on paper

I order online groceries yesterday picked a time, and yes needed to reschedule.

I called the store upper James ST in Hamilton Ontario they said it was rescheduled. But I had a feeling it was not. So, I called the helpline and they said the order had not been and then did what was required and promised me of a delivery slot between 9 and 10 on the 15th.

Online on the 15th may I see the delivery and the driver was picking it up at 915. At 10 30 I called the helpline as they had not been delivered.

Speaking with them they tell me the only thing they can do is refund and then I have to re orded. ( what customer service order again go to the end of the line)


NOT only that, how do they know I can afford to wait 5 – 10 business days to have the refund back. How do they know that I have that money to reorder. And If I don’t, I should tighten my belt and not eat till the refund is in my account. I will admit I am not in this situation but disabled people elderly … most would be on fixed income and could not afford this. I do use this service for the same reason I messed up my knee and back and larger orders I cannot Carrie them.

What I would expect when this happens is you call the help line, they call the store and tell them to resend the order.

BUT they did call the store and they could not send it as the driver who had it out of the store for 2 hours at that point had not returned it. I DO NOT WANT GROCERIES THAT HAVE BEEN IN SOMEONE'S CAR FOR 2 HOURS. And why that would apply?

So I found out that Walmart was having issues of whatever type driver staff booking... and the solution is to refund the order and ask you to reorder! Not to fix their issues and also just call the store re-pick the order and send asap with an apology. That is truly expecting the minimum, to receive goods you paid for late, but things happen I realize but they fixed it.

Lest than satisfactory is refunding the order, waiting 5 business days for the money to be put back taking the time to reorder. I hope you kept what the order was as can no longer see it online.

IF THE PERSON CAN AFFORD TO SORT OF THAT YOUR POLICY DOES NOT CARE IF THEY GO WITHOUT.

And yes for me realizing and tracking your miss handling of my order. calling spending over an hour on the phone on the 2 times on the 14 to get it rebooked about 30 min promised a 9-10 am slot ( just to note what the promise from a representative is worth from Walmart) then on the 15 May another over 1 hours on the phone with customer service. They did keep saying if you would like sir we can refund the order. I did not want a refund so no I did not like as the refund takes time to be returned to the account it came out of. Then if reordering WHO IS TO SAY THE SAME THING WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

I just wanted my groceries. Call tell the store repick and ship.



Instead, you get for this service lost time frustration money in limbo for approximately 5 business days. For all this Walmart gave me $20.00 and said they would like me to reorder from them unfortunately I did.



I asked what if it happens again, they said they would escalate it, why was that not done to start with. In other words, they would refund again and start again. I think they have a name forl doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting a different result hmm.",2022-05-15

I'm sorry? I received them BROKEN before they were even delivered to my apartment and now I have to pay EVEN MORE for controllers that are broken? That's a joke.

I bought a Ps4 controller about two to three weeks ago, coming from my own country. I usually get packages that comes from close to japan and it gets in within a week. I contacted them also because they never provided any tracking. The worst they done was to send me an email two weeks ago saying the item was shipped but if Id check, everyday the ""shipping date"" (the date they sent the package) was always changing for the date of the day. The item had no tracking and they weren’t able to provide ANY information about the position of the package or if it was even shipped or getting prepared. They assured in a email 40 minutes later that the item was on the way but again, without any tracking. The same day they refunded me.

The thing doesn’t end there because about 3 days later they took my money AGAIN but never got to me with any information. I was patient for a whole week but still, no updates or informations given. This looks like a big joke or if it isn’t, it’s a scam. I don’t believe inside 3 weeks an item form probably around 8h from here cant get to destination on time, or at least in less than two weeks.

If you dont have weeks and months to loose with them, AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS. All the reviews are correct, none of them is exaggerating. Walmart is really careless with ur package and won’t lift a finger to help you with it while they take, give back, take, give back and take again. They will call you to tell you nothing and will put the blame on others all the time.

Fine, I understand I need to do the work and return the pants, but then when I asked them to ship out another sprinkler timer, I was told I'd have to put in a brand new order for the product and they were unable to facilitate. So I'd potentially have to wait for my refund, then purchase again, and hope the right product arrives. 10 business days after I received the notification that Walmart has received my item back, I still haven't been refunded. I contacted customer service again and their solution is to ""escalate"" this to another department and asked me to check my bank account in 3-5 days, if I do not receive the funds, call back..

Employees treating customers in a sub-standard manner is bad for business. When customers are treated poorly (or extremely well), they will tell everyone they know about it.

I had a horrible experience at your store in Amherst, Nova Scotia today. The cashier was wonderful (so, please don't reprimand her; she did nothing wrong), but it just takes one experience with a rude employee after to leave a bitter taste in your mouth.

After we were done shopping, my husband and I were getting ready to leave. He needed to use the washroom. I drove the motorised cart close to the entrance/exit area, waiting. (The other motorised cart was still available).

We had purchased home related items (bedsheets, etc.). So, I waved the receipt to the employee standing at the front entrance area, before I put my receipt inside the packaging of one of the items.

I stood up to just put my phone (with my credit card) into my pocket. Next thing I know, this other employee (elderly white male) is eyeing my legs, as if ambulatory wheelchair users don't exist.

He then approaches me and asks me if I need the cart. I say ""yes, of course"". He prods me with the same question repeatedly, and now I'm finding myself having to explain my physical issues (which is really none of his business).

He then proceeds with ""you'll know what it's really like when you're my age"" and then goes on and on about all the surgeries he's had. It's unfortunate that he's had several surgeries, but that is no excuse to antagonise me when I am just trying to shop and leave.

He then asks to see my receipt (note, he wasn't doing this for other customers; he wasn't the employee standing at the entrance for any of this; this was clearly a personally targeted situation). I pull it out of the packaging I tucked it into and he goes over every item line by line. Again, this would make sense if he was doing this for all customers, but nope. Just me, AFTER giving me grief for using the motorised cart that is there for people like me who need it to shop.

When my husband (white able-bodied male) arrived, his tone changed, but he still goes on and on, and follows us for a bit, as we are trying to leave. We just ended the conversation and left as quickly as possible.

In the past, I have been rudely asked if I need the motorised cart (which I absolutely do), and it is annoying, but they don't normally keep bothering me with it. It's a minor annoyance. What happened today was well beyond that. It was ableist, racist, sexist and ageist, especially when he started following us and saying that his friend with arthritis works on a computer all day. Cool, I also have arthritis and work on a computer all day. Just because I'm a disabled woman of colour doesn't mean that I am lazy or have no career.

Train your employees to not harass disabled POC customers at your stores. That kind of behaviour is unacceptable.",2022-03-13

Walmart apparently outsource their deliveries through one company, called Loomis Express. This carrier is the absolutely worst company I have ever had to deal with (Walmart Canada follows close in second place). They did not allow their drivers to call my phone when they got to the delivery location, even though I called Loomis several times to explain that our buzzers do not work. Because of the laziness, they stopped by a couple times and could not deliver my orders.
I decided then to cancel my purchase from Walmart, one of the most difficult tasks ever performed by a human being. The customer service agents sound like robots, always answering you the same rehearsed speech, then proceed to promise you that your purchase is going to be cancelled and assuring you that you will be notified in 24 to 72 hours about the request.
You can wait as much as you want, but you will never receive an email or a phone call from them, if you ask to talk to a supervisor, a 24h waiting time is awarded to you.

The website is not great either - the search feature is wonky and cost calculations at checkout are always bugged for me (the additions are off).

I was willing to keep taking a chance on them regardless, because they would at least refund me any wrongly-substituted items, and the orders would still be mostly correct.

But my most recent order was missing over 90% of items - not because they didn't have them in stock (I was already warned about 2 of my ordered items being out of stock and I was fine with this), but seemingly because of an error or oversight at the store.

I was able to get a refund on the missing items, but I wanted to see if I could get at least a partial refund on the fees too, because I ended up paying way more for delivery & handling than for the actual items I received (just a few apples and carrots). Obviously if I had known I would be receiving only about ~5$ worth of items, I wouldn't have agreed to pay 10+$ in fees!

The customer service agent assured me it would be possible to refund these fees and I would be getting an email in a handful of business days... I eventually got the email and there was no mention of any fees.

Meanwhile, the tracking still says the item was delivered. I replied to Walmart asking for further information but never got reply. Few days later, an email was send to me asking me to provide the review of my purchase. I provided negative review based on my experience and the posting of the review was rejected by Walmart. It said the review was outside of the review scope. Apparently Walmart learned my negative experiences in multiple occasions but yet, no one followed up with me to rectified the situation.

It is essentially my fault for accepting but all I was told was I would get $40 off of my purchase right away by signing up to be on a mailing list. I had a big bill to pay that day and they told me after I cannot pay it until my card comes in the mail in a few weeks. Now that I have gotten it they told me I can only pay using cash or debit which I do not have the full funds to do at this point. I tried contacting them multiple times (including going into the store) to cancel the card and let me pay my bill right away but I was never successful. My issue was not fixed and now I owe them way OVER what I initially was supposed to pay because they are now charging me interest on a card I was given complete false information on. Not once was I told I couldn't pay my bill in store that day, I was not told I have to pay cash to pay my bill in  a few weeks, I was not told I was even signing up for the walmart credit card which I have avoided multiple times before because I already knew what it was about and I did not want to be stuck in this situation. I was not told any info about anything to do with this until after I was signed up and then he proceeded to tell me that I cannot back out until I have received my card in the mail. I am at a loss owing way over $100 more then what my regular bill would have been if he didn't sign me up for this BS. I never want to step foot in this place again, the service sucks, the manager did not help me at all. I was told after that this guy has done this to multiple people. THAT IS WRONG! I get it , its your job to promote that but it is extremely unprofessional not to give the customer ALL the information of what you are really signing them up for instead of lying about what it really was and going forward with it anyways. I am not an angry person usually, I have never once wrote a review somewhere if I felt I had bad service but this is over the top and I am beyond angry.

To start things off, I was given an invalid Canada Post tracking number.  I contacted Customer Service to try to obtain a correct one so I could track the whereabouts of my package.  They in turn said they would contact the 3rd party seller.  The seller responded to me with the vaguest of responses, basically saying ""it was in transit"".  Needless to say, my question was NOT answered, nor did I receive a proper tracking number.  I contacted Walmart customer service again who told me that my package was coming from Toronto.  I live 45 minutes away FROM Toronto.  Also, the email address from the 3rd party seller who contacted me was Chinese, which led me to believe China was the originating country from where my package was supposedly sent.  Anyway, I was supposed to receive the Christmas tree by November 16th, which of course didn't happen.  Still no tracking number to fall upon, nor any relevant information from neither the 3rd party seller or Walmart customer service.  After contacting them multiple times trying to get at least ONE straight answer, I gave up and asked for a refund, which I did fortunately receive a couple of days later.

I had asked that the batteries be shipped to the Walmart store at 9855 Austin Ave. CI have contact Walmart Canada on many occasions by Supervisors and was told that the Walmart store at 9855 Austin Ave, Burnaby would offer me a complete credit of $26.16 as I decided not tto pick up the product and have it returned to Walmart.ca. When I contacted the store they said that they could only refund the $8.92 plus gst as they had no knowledge of the shipping fees as the shipping fees do not show up on their invoice. I have ask on 2 seperate occasions after talking with the Supervisors that I would like to speak to a Manager but to date no one has called me or emailed me. It was indicated to me by the Supervisors that I would receive a full refund and they have me 2 return reference numbers that I was to give to the store. The only way I can get a refund for the shipping charges has to come directly from Customer Service at Walmart.ca.",2021-12-04

I knew the batteries were from a 3rd party seller, Premium Battery, but there were only 3 items in the order and it was only around $30 for them. So it was under their stated (3rd party in store returns, max 3 items, under C$150) 3rd party return policy on their website under returning 3rd party items. Anyway, they were the wrong size, so I brought them back to store #3082 Sarnia. The lady took them, unopened, and submitted a return for refund. I only got refunded for 1 battery pack. When I tried using their onlne live chat, I kept getting told to be patient. 2 weeks later, still no refund for the other 2 packs. I finally went back to the store where they accepted the original return, and the customer service person contacted the store duty manager and asked her what to do. The duty manager basically told me I was SOL, because I had ordered from a 3rd party through the Walmart website, and that it was my problem to contact the seller and pester them for my refund. Since their online 3rd party in store return policy says nothing of the sort, I'm probably going to try to get their Head Office in Mississauga on Argentia involved, if I can figure out how to contact them. If I get no satisfaction there, I'll think about pursuing a legal remedy, because there's nothing in their 3rd party return policy online, that says it's now my problem, and not theirs. The sad part is they've lost a lifelong customer, over a C$16.50 refund. Pretty pathetic on their part. The initial return was made on November 10, and the store #3082 duty manager gave me the final middle finger salute on November 29. I will never shop there again, in person or online, unless there's absolutely no way to avoid it. We use them mostly for groceries and prescription drugs, and we can easily get them elsewhere. If this had been Amazon, they'd have made good on it, because almost all their sellers are 3rd party, and their customer service is excellent. Even eBay has never screwed me around like this. I would strongly warn/recommend to anyone considering using Walmart.ca online, to verify the return policy for their purchase in advance, and get it in writing, if possible.
I should also add that after Walmart Sarnia gave me the brush off, I decided to try to contact the 3rd party seller myself, Premium Battery, using Walmart's ""Contact Seller"" button in my order details, even though I shouldn't have to, based on their 3rd party seller, return/refund policy. I wrote the following note and this was the reply from Walmart's (probably) automated message forwarding system for ""Contact Seller"".

Good day, I recently purchased 3 LR44 battery packs. As it turned out, they were the wrong size. I went to Walmart store # 3082 in Sarnia after I realized the problem, and requested a return/refund of all 3 battery blister packs. They were all unopened. They took the 3 items, and initiated the return refund, and within a day I received a refund to my credit card, but it was only for 1 of the battery packs. I'm still waiting for the refund on the other 2. The Walmart order number was 5062141001451. Thank you, Michael K.

As you can see, the Walmart message forwarding system sent my note to a recipient named ""Global Exports USA"", not to ""Premium Battery"".

Walmart couldn't even forward my note to the correct 3rd party seller. Thanks Walmart. I don't think I'll be hearing from anyone, anytime soon, if this is your best effort.

Again, I would caution anyone planning on using Walmart.ca to buy anything online, particularly from a 3rd party seller, to research every aspect of your purchase beforehand.
UPDATE - 03DEC21 - After weeks of waiting for the rest of the refund from my battery return, and coincidentally, after letting Trustpilot send my first draft review to Walmart Canada, I just got an email from Walmart Canada saying my refund has been processed. It hasn't been posted to my credit card yet, but I'm at least hopeful that this saga is nearing an end. I am raising their rating to the middle of the pack (3 stars) until I do get the refund. I will update again, when that happens.
UPDATE # 2: I have raised my rating to 4 stars, as I FINALLY GOT THE REST OF THE REFUND AFTER 3 WEEKS OF AGONY. No one should have to wait that long for a full refund. Their 3rd party return/refund system needs some work. I am partly satisfied for now.",2021-12-03

have ended up with mutant enormous eggplant and spaghetti squash that are sold by weight. These ridiculously extra large items aren't always the best tasting. On two occasions, they have randomly increased the quantity of produce items significantly and again these are sold by weight. I become annoyed and then have had to contact their customer service which defeats the whole ease and convenience factor.
Though the items are refunded quickly, who needs the extra aggravation.and unreliability. I then must discard food and go out again to replace the items I wanted, doubling my time and effort.

The game console was at a very low price and they had two versions on the web. I order one and 4 days later got an email that stated my order was cancelled. No reason given. I phoned Walmart customer service and the first person I talked to took 15 minutes and then said your order was cancelled. Great information. I asked to speak to a supervisor and did not get much further. Manya the supervisor I spoke with said the same thing.
She stated your order was cancelled and told me I will not be charged. I explained politely that I do not want to cancel the order. I want the product or something similar. She told me my problem was resolved than hung up on me. Wow great customer service.
If Walmart is going to have a market place they need to ensure that they sellers are reliable and trustworthy. Macegames should be removed from the marketplace seller list and Walmart should ensure that they correct the problem and honour the order. Walmart also needs to understand that hanging up on a customer is not good customer service.",2021-10-21

They said at first they couldn't cancel, but eventually assured me the order would be cancelled. It never was, and they delivered this wrong item to my son's apt when there was no one present there.
Because they had assured me that the first order would be cancelled, I then ordered the proper size, a queen.
They have my address, and not my son's addr as the delivery address. To date, every time I talk to an agent on the phone I get someone from India who messes up the order again. I go to chat, and they continue to knock me off chat and I end up with a different agent every 5 minutes or so. So I have to type the entire experience again for that new person and, yes, I get knocked off chat and the whole experience repeats.

1) Purchased product, have not heard anything back for a while. When i called, i was informed that my order has not moved yet and my cc has not been charged.
2) I asked them i was moving so if i could change the address or cancel the order to avoid any issues. Agent mentioned that he can cancel the order no problem. I asked for a cancelation email and was informed that i should receive it on Monday
3) Monday comes, now my cc is charged, no cancellation email.
4) I called back and mentioned all this to the agent and asked them for an email stating this conversation took place. The agent said ""We do not have access to an email!"" Just wow... So he gave me a case number instead.
5) I wish it ended there, but this is just the beginning. Next day, i received an email that my item, which was supposed to be already cancelled, has been shipped.
6) I called them and ask for a manager to call me as this is getting out of hand. I asked for an email stating that someone will reach out to me, yet was given the same answer ""We do not have access to a corporate email"" I was promised a call in 2 hours max as this was escalated, guess what. No call.
7) I called them back again and reiterated that I no longer live in my old address.. Agent informed me that as i will not be present in my old adress, as long as no one signs the order (as this is a large item) or get refused at the door, it will ship back and i will get my refund.
8) Finally, they sent the order to my old address and left it in front of old adress...my old landlord called me and informed me of this. I had to drive back all the way to my old address, try to fit this large item to my car and finally brought it back to Walmart for a refund.

Still waiting after many requests.  Found out that the issue was never even sent to their IT Dept. from my initial 4 calls with Customer Service.  Started all over again only to  get nowhere.  Don’t worry they said, they will fix the issue within 24-48 hours they say, I am now on my fourth  24-48 hours of waiting and still nothing has been done.  All this frustration to just buy something on-line. I am still getting message saying they are unable to find an account with my email address, told to reapply on line only to get message saying it was already assigned to someone ... which is me!  This has already been confirmed by them.  I was told that it is simple to fix this issue if their IT Dept would just reset my account from their end. instead  IT can’t be bothered and have suggested that l should just set up a different email account and cellphone number that isn’t already linked to this account and start again. How exactly is this a solution to the problem at their end and why is it that Walmart has no problem sending me flyers and other junk mail to this exact email address? If that isn’t bad enough l just received an email offering me a $15discount on my next online order.  It might as well be $10000.00 if l can’t check out on line.  What a JOKE!

After spending another hour + on the phone and live chat still no further forward. The customer service at Walmart are completely useless. And now they are saying it will be another 2 to 4 business days to look i to why the items have not even shipped. Whats so hard to put a note to have the item picked from the warehouse. But noooooooo they can't do that USELESS.
So we are now a further 3 days and still no movement on the items. So called up again and told them to cancel the order. But now being told by the cuntemer service that it can't be cancelled. And told that they would escalate this to manager level to get the items shipped. Told them no point in shipping the items now because we went to a store and purchased the items. But told yet again the order could not be cancelled even though it had still not shipped. It's getting to the point now that i am going to have to call my cc company and explain the situation to them. And the fact wallyworld customer service staff are refusing to cancel an order that was supposed to be delivered May 4th and it is now May 9th and still hasn't shipped. The nightmare continues and i will NEVER buy from Walmart online or set foot in a store again.

Date: 3 May,2021 evening.
Very poor customer service. I needed Blood Pressure monitor machine from Electronic Thermometer rack which was locked, so I asked Walmart employee to open it up for me & she replied me to wait. I waited for around more than 15 minutes then I asked another girl to send someone to open this lock & I’m already waiting & no one show up. She page still even after 10 minutes no one showed. So, I asked from another girl who was in clothing department & explained her the situation. She replied that she’ll either send someone to open it or brought keys. I waited from around 1/2 hour for someone to show up with keys. I even called Electronic Department, which goes blank then again to customer service to explain them everything. Luckily, after 30-40 minutes, lock was finally open & I was so frustrated by the service. I would like to give zero star. For single thing, I’ve to wait for 30-40 min & never know how long if I need more products to buy. It didn’t end here, I went straight to customer service desk, ask for store manager or supervisor but they end up calling someone who wasn’t even senior employee. Then I asked for head office contact details so they called someone & told me that store supervisor is busy and asked me to wait. Why they wasted my time in calling someone who wasn’t even a store supervisor or manager. I don’t want to wait any longer & I just get head office’s number and complain them about this whole incident & horrible customer service.",2021-05-04

So I called Walmart and they told me the shipper is third party. I contacted the third party and they said they will contact after 48 hours and 48 hours passed no response.

I placed an order for delivery between 11am-12pm. No delivery. I was told to wait a few hours. Nothing. Wait until 6pm. Nothing. Wait until 10.30pm. Again, nada. I am then told that evening - that I would absolutely with out doubt be receiving my order the next morning between 9am-10am. Guaranteed.

Unsurprisingly my $350 order was a no show. But I did get an email at 1.25am(!!!) to say its been delivered. I was told by Walmart to check outside my door (I live in a condo) or to ask my neighbours - some how I highly doubt at 1.25am they were accepting my order. My concierge also do not hold deliveries or packages due to Covid. So because Walmart messed up, I have to be refunded. Great now I have to wait for my money before I can reorder? Plus the next order slot is two days away. This does not help me in-between as I was relying on my order to be fulfilled.

On top of that Walmart offered a whole $5 compensation for the inconvenience. A billion dollar company said the best they can do is $5. I got a $20 eVoucher previously, just for having stuff sat in my cart for 48 hours and they best they can do after failing at their literal job is...$5. Also waiting for a call back - can take between 24-48 hours?! Ridiculous. Telling me this never happens, when the rating on here is 1 star and FULL of complaints about poor service says otherwise.

Use Instacart - shop anywhere else. This is abhorrent service.",2021-04-28

Part of my order was supposed to be shipped, got the email from Walmart and UPS saying it would be here today but yet, the item never left the warehouse. When I called, the call centre agent kept telling me no, it was scheduled for next week to the point that I lost my patience (since I have emails and on my account, it says today). I requested to speak to a supervisor (not her colleague next to her, this happens a lot in call centres) but no, apparently those don't exist, you have to wait 48 hours for someone to get back to you (or as soon as possible, which is basically saying, someone will call you back whenever, maybe). If my delivery date was changed, why did I not receive an email from Walmart? Why couldn't the agent put me on hold and verify why this happened instead of insisting I was wrong (calling your customer liars isn't a great way to do business)

I called back to cancel my order, I could barely understand the guy who answered (very thick accent and so much echo and static on the line it was bad), he told me I can't cancel my order because I passed a certain deadline... My order hasn't even been shipped, no one is working on it, I should be able to cancel it. He again started to tell me it was scheduled for next week.... I told him no, repeated the above, I again said I wanted to cancel and I'll get my things from Amazon. He hung up on me without saying anything (except I was transferred to customer service a survey) I never swore at him, never insulted him, had I risen my tone of voice, yes, I was getting very annoyed at being told I was wrong/lying.

So now, my options are to refused delivery, which will be impossible since couriers don't knock on your door anymore or start a return process will take for ever to get my money back.

I already re-ordered the same things from Amazon, my items will be here tomorrow for $3.00 less.",2021-04-28

It arrived three hours late, and the men on the truck just threw the bags at us, out the back, while telling us “this is why you should do curb-side” and pick up your orders. They explained they were upset with a shortage of drivers. During the throwing of the bags into my buggy, they damaged the eggs because they didn’t care about what they were doing. They didn’t even look at what was in them, half our food was falling out because they ripped the bags by hanging heavy items by one handle. Plenty of items were missing without being reported and ALL of our frozen foods have been thawed.

The thing that really made me angry was hearing they cannot bring the groceries into an apartment complex. Last minute. Every other company leaves it at your door. Had I known that, I would have done the pick up myself as I have been doing. Was just trying the safest option. But the majority of my residence is elderly, and if they had to carry those bags alone up 12 flights - I’d get a full refund or turn the order around. Be kind, and efficient in putting these things on your website. I know it’s a deterrent to some, but for good reason. If you don’t deliver to the door, plenty will avoid your service. Some have no choice but to go another route as they can’t bring in the groceries all by themselves.

However, by the time the order was delivered 3 hours later, many of the items which had been listed as 'in stock' on Walmart's website were unavailable. As a result, the delivery fee ended up being about 25% of the total amount of goods that we received. In my mind, the delivery fee should have been prorated to reflect the missing items (for the record, the missing items were not priceless one of a kind goods...we are talking about a box of Cheerios amd garbage bags). I contacted Walmart Customer Service and was told that they cannot compensate us for the missing items, they believe that they did their part by not charging for them.

However, my item I was told is lost in transit from their Mississauga warehouse (20 minutes away from my location), according to customer service.  I have  yet to hear back for an answer (resolve) I was told I can't cancel my order because it is in ""transit"" , albeit lost. If the store has the product,  why can't the store place it in the pick up area?  This is not cost effective for Walmart and shows a very poor business model. This was my first online order through Walmart and it will be my last. The Bay and Amazon delivered on or before the expected delivery date and were excellent in their status updates. There's no excuse for this pathetic delivery service. I will never recommend Walmart online. Walmart, you need to step up and stop taking your customers for granted!!!After 10 day's and two promises of someone contacting me and still no word. Canadian Tire, The Bay, Lowe's, Rona and Amazon have never failed me, I am sticking to them. We need to boycott Walmart or they will continue to get away with this crummy service.Just thought I'd add that I received an  order prior to the delivery date, it came from China. I ordered this item the same time as the air fryer. An order delivered from 11000 km away arrived sooner than the order that is 22 km away, how does that make sense? Four calls now made to Walmart for the first order and still no resolve.I am obviously not the only disgruntled customer based on all the negative reviews. This review however is my first. I am generally not a complainer but I felt I had to put this review out there. Everyone I know has had multiple negative results from Walmart online(wish I had talked to them prior to placing my order). Lesson learned....",2021-04-16

On Feb 10 I received an email saying that my bed had been delivered.  I was at home, and had been for several days because of the lockdown.  When I next went into the office, I expected to find a 330-pound bed leaned up against the building, proving they had gotten the address completely wrong.  Instead I found a phonemail message from the delivery firm asking which loading dock to deliver to.  I called them and cancelled the delivery.  They delivered back to Walmart.  Since then I have called weekly to get my refund.  The delivery firm has provided the new tracking number for the return, but that hasn't yet helped.  Every time I call I get another runaround.  Sometimes they say they are ""escalating"" my refund.  Sometimes they tell me to get a police report to prove the bed was stolen from me, when it was never delivered.  Sometimes they tell me that the refund is approved.  Sometimes they tell me they are searching the warehouse.  Sometimes they tell me they just need another couple of days to sort it out (that's at various points in the last 12 weeks).  They clearly do not care.  This is over $1200 of my money that Walmart refuses to return, for a bed that I never received because Walmart mis-delivered it to my office instead of the shipping address I gave them, my home in another town.  It's way beyond infuriating.",2021-04-14

I'm not able to go into a shoe store to try shoes on as they're closed for lockdown so Walmart is only place where I could. Also nobody was following the 6 feet distancing nor did any workers say anything to customers all clustered together in isles and not following the arrows indicated on the floor.

The young lad who brought my order was the only employee who was truly interested in helping to resolve the issue and apologetic - he escalated the error on my behalf. The next day, I had still not heard back from Wal-Mart. I called customer service and they told me unapologetically that the remainder of the items were not in stock. This was only after first showing an unwillingness to even hear my concerns. When I asked why I would have received an email advising that all of my items were available for pick-up, and only found out the next day that the remaining items were out of stock because I called in, the Supervisor responded in an uninterested tone that usually the customer would receive an email with a revised order and didn't know why I did not. She offered absolutley no resolution and behaved as though she could care less. I will shop at Canadian Tire exclusively from now on. At least when their stores are out of stock, they demonstrate good customer service by sending and regret email with a revised order!

Talking to their customer service reps is frustrating, as their phone system seems to cut in and out constantly. My phone is fine, as my calls are clear otherwise.

If this were Amazon or many other retailers, I would have had my refund in hand days ago. Usually a simple click is enough to get a refund, but not with this company.

These folks are not ready to do business online. I had an easier time dealing with Sears before they went out of business, and that's something.

Walmart Canada is a horrible business with horrible customer service!

January 18th I purchased an IPad off the app. It was suppose to be delivered by January 22nd by end of day January 22nd i had not recieved my package as promised so I called. They contacted 3rd party seller (which I was not aware l they were sending from) as the product hadn't even been shipped yet. I asked to cancel the order and to have a refund. They said they would message the third party seller and it shouldn't be a problem because it hadn't been shipped. Later that day I recieved an email from the 3rd party refusing my refund and them saying give it 3-5 business for it to ship. I then called walmart back on the 24th to cancel it for a SECOND time and was told sure shouldn't be a problem, it hasn't shipped. This time a few days went by and 3rd party refused again! Saying give it 10 to 15 business days. Instantly became very aware that this 3rd party company was not going to listen. Fast forward 2.5 months also...still no product, still no refund, and I've called weekly sometime multiples times in a week. I've spoken to several different supervisors who have told me they would escalate this to their bills payable department, with multiple promises of getting my refund. Just last week after yet another call to walmart, I recieved an email from the 3rd party stating my package has arrived...I was home all week and nothing came in the mail!! I have reached out to walmart they assured me I would be getting a refund. With yet another email from 3rd party refusing!!! Capital one has been notified of an authorized payment on my card. Fraud investigation is under way.!!

When someone orders through a business, that business takes on all responsibilities. Walmart does not take ownership ship of it and a supervisor had the nerve to tell me to reach out to 3rd after reading all emails between us. I told them I have and nothing was being done.

After taxes came out to be $787.58 CAD (Almost $800).
I was told from confirmation that the items were to be delivered by March 18th 2021.
March 18th came and then at the end of day they sent an email to me that there is a delay.
I was waiting all day for this item as these are heavy items and someone needs to be in the unit of my condo to pick these up. I don't expect my condo's concierge to hold these as they will be over 100lbs.

Then the shipment date was delayed to March 23,2021.
Again waiting at home for this item.

Contacted Walmart customer service and was assured that this should arrive today.

Guess what. No more emails showing that my items will be delayed and i was waiting all day.
Then I contacted customer service once again on the 24th to see where my items were.
Walmart's status on their website shows that my items are DELIVERED.
I checked the shipping courier for my package and it is showing "" Product has not arrived in HUB"".
Customer service tells me , There is a delay, We are sorry but please contact us in 28 hrs, your item should arrive by then.
So being patient I waited again for another 48hrs.
By this time. Walmart already took my almost $800 and gave me a notice that I have until a certain date to return my items for a refund and that my order is delivered.

But I didn't get my items yet, And what if my items come damaged?
Why are they taking my money and why do I have no idea WHEN my items will arrive?
I am unemployed currently and $800 is alot of money for me.
Due to the pandemic I was hoping that i may start working out as gyms are not either safe to be in at this moment or not opened ( also i have raspatory medical issues so - not safe for me to go).

Well I contact Walmart today to see what is the status of my order, They tell me it's on it's way again.
I told them I am no longer willing to wait. I am not having any confidence with this purchase as I do not know WHEN I will receive the items. and you guys already took my money over a week ago.
So I demanded a refund.
I was denied a refund and told ONCE AGAIN that my item will be in 72 hrs. ( now 72 hrs? when I was told March 18th, Then March 23rd, then 48 hrs,. and now 72 hrs? )

https://ca.trustpilot.com/users/605ac20b780813001452b83f,1,Walmart grocery delivery is the worst I've ever seen,"Apparently the 1st driver refused to pick up my order and never even bother to call me to let me know. Walmart had to call me to let me know of this; when it was already time for my order to be delivered and I was already in front of my building waiting...

Eventually a 2nd driver ended up picking up my order and delivering it, 15 minutes after the end of my 1 hour slot...

And then, half of my order was missing!
In addition to the items I received I had also ordered 3 packs of 32 cans of friskies wet cat food for my cats. And a few hours before my delivery was supposed to happen, I got an email saying those items were 'unavailable' and that I 'wouldn't be charged'...

Guess what? I was still charged for those items I haven't received! I placed my order on March 19, to be delivered on March 23, from 9pm to 10 pm (the only slot there was available when I ordered) and, on the day I ordered, the full amount of my order was taken from my bank account...

And yet, they simply decided not to deliver half my order, but they still tool my money... Nice scam...

This was my first time trying the grocery delivery from Walmart and will be the last.

Service was absolutely ridiculous!

And I will make a complaint to the appropriate authorities on the fact I never got a refund of the 3 items I paid for but they decided not to deliver... That's called theft and it's a criminal offence...",2021-03-24

https://ca.trustpilot.com/users/6059e0e21cfac200132dbfb0,2,First & last purchase from Walmart's horrid online store (Walmart.ca),"After purchasing a bike I bought which was ""Sold & Shipped"" by Walmart NOT any other third-party seller, the site said that it was in stock, and my product could be delivered by March 25, but I was pretty bummed out that it took way too long for the product to be delivered, just to receive a refund after 2 weeks. I never really had high expectations about Walmart especially with all the bad reviews and much better online competitors such as Amazon and many other e-commerce stores.

I didn't mind that much that it took that long to ship, but the lack of communication on my product status was really a big issue, was constantly worried about where my product was, or whether it lost might have been lost during shipping, but at last, I finally got my refund after 2 weeks, which honestly felt like a waste of time in my personal opinion. I understand that a global pandemic is still ongoing, but the service is pretty unacceptable, as mentioned above there are much better online competitors to Walmart, but unfortunately, this company mainly here in Canada is failing to keep up with the online competition.

Overall, your better off saving time, and money elsewhere on other e-commerce sites until things change.",2021-03-23

https://ca.trustpilot.com/users/6047ce14e664b70019e7023b,1,Disgraceful customer service...,"My husband and I have never had the luxury of owning a fancy flat screen tv.  This past Christmas our two daughters had saved up enough money to purchase one for us.  It was a Black Friday sale and they ordered it online as there weren’t any in stock at our local Walmart.  It was ordered in November 2020, they received it on December 5 and hid it from us until Christmas morning.  It is a 65” RCA 4K smart tv.  It is now March 9 and it’s toast.  The picture suddenly went into millions of horizontal lines and the unit is unresponsive.  Phoned Walmart Canada customer service this morning for assistance with a refund or exchange and all I can say is I am not often ever speechless but today I was.  ZERO HELP.  Rude doesn’t even touch it.  To say they were ignorant is being polite.  We were told pretty much that it sucks to be us, deal with it.  The 90 day warranty has expired.  Nothing they can do.  It was a Christmas gift... we didn’t receive it until December 25.  We should still be covered until March 25 but they told us they go by the order date.  Unbelievable.  They told us to contact RCA and deal with them now.  RCA wants the TV RETURNED TO THEM IN ITS ORIGINAL PACKAGING, at OUR cost, before they will send out a replacement tv.  We didn’t keep the box so again, sucks to be us.  We have the receipt and that should be enough!  They should send us the replacement first and pick up the broken one at the same time in my opinion, AT THEIR COST.  As far as a refund goes, they won’t issue one until they receive the broken one in the original box.  Not happy at all.  We feel terrible that our kids are out $600.   We can’t afford to purchase another tv.  Neither company offered any other possible solutions or compromises.  As long as we live, neither one of us will EVER set foot in a Walmart store again.  We will NEVER buy another RCA product or any other product put out by Curtis Industries Ltd.",2021-03-09

https://ca.trustpilot.com/users/6027e63e0da303001b803b5f,1,"Liars, cheaters, and snakes","Over the winter holidays, I adopted a puppy, so I felt it necessary to up my cleaning game. I ventured onto the web and saw the Deebot Ozmo 930 mop & vac robot on sale on Walmart Canada’s online website for $429.98 from $999.99. This was a holiday sale. Since the product reviews checked out, and the price seemed fair, I thought I'd buy one for myself but also for my mother who hates dust, dirt and grime. The rules were 1 per person, so I naturally ordered one for myself and ordered one for her (under her name) as my mother comes from an era before computers and the internet. My own order went through without a hitch, and I received the product only a few days after the indicated date - no biggie. However, the order placement for my mother's Deebot was a horror story. I would place the order, and it would be accepted, but then 30 minutes later I'd receive an email that my order was cancelled. This happen at least 10 times. I must have lost 2-3 hours trying to order the Deebot for my mother. Eventually, I decided to call customer support. Oh my gosh, if I was in a horror story before, I just officially just entered the gates of hell where deception is the language of the day. At first glance, there was nothing to raise an eyebrow toward. The customer service rep I spoke to listened to my issue with the successive ordering and cancellations - I even gave reference numbers so they could see exactly what I was dealing with. The rep informed me that the server could not handle all the online traffic, so my order was getting cancelled. They indicated that I should order the product at a specific time, I think it was 3 or 4 AM. I did exactly as they informed. I woke up at the hour that I'd suspect a serial killer wakes up, and I got online all groggy to place the order only to go right back to bed immediately after making sure I received the confirmation email with the reference number. To my surprise, when I woke up later the same day and checked my email... BOOM... another order cancellation email. I called back again, spoke to a different rep, who was friendly like the first, but this rep told me that the order was not going through because the fulfillment centre was awaiting restock. The problem was that the estimated date of restock was after the sale end date. I expressed my disappointment about this as I only wanted to order the product at the price point of ~$430, and not the ~$1,000. The rep assured me that I could place the order next week via phone at the ~$430 price point because of the ordering issues that I was facing, and the time I had lost because of the upsetting circumstance. I was content, I thanked the rep, asked him to make notes on the issue and provide me with a reference # so that I could provide it to the next rep I would speak to the following week. A week passed and I called customer service yet again, reference # in hand. The first rep I spoke to asked me to go online and order directly off the online website, they indicated that the price was still the same on the website. I shouldn't have been so naïve and let the phone call end. When I went online a little while later, the price was NOT ~$430, it was ~$600. My eyes rolled back so fast and so abruptly that I literally would have fallen over had I not been sitting down. I called back YET AGAIN, this time, the rep told me that the order cancellation was my own fault, because my credit card company was not honouring the order. LOL.

I literally get at least 2 - 3 ""you've been pre-approved for a credit increase"" letters in the mail every month. When I ask to speak to the manager, the phone call mysteriously ends. *eye roll* I call back YET AGAIN, this time, the rep is nice, listens to me, but then at the end of the call simply informs me that they cannot do anything, regardless of the fact that I have a reference # to a note that was left a week earlier providing the background story and the promise from the earlier rep who informed I'd be able to purchase the Deebot at the ~$430 price point. Get this.... this rep tells me that they cannot see this note. LOL. this is hilarious because an earlier rep told me that they could see it! LOL. So, either the rep who hung up on me deleted it, or someone along the way was lying – either intentionally or unintentionally. Anyways, I don't normally leave reviews such as the same, but Walmart just stole at least 5-6 hours of my time and gave me broken promises that it seems they never intended to fulfill. Shame on you Walmart. I will not be making any Walmart purchases any time soon again and I implore others to look elsewhere as well. The way Walmart is treating its online customers is not acceptable and we should band together so that they notice and take action. Thank you.",2021-02-13

DO not buy, repeat Do not buy third party products from Walmart. They do not have at all customer respect responsibility as AMAZON does. NO COMPARISON with Amazon. Walmart's warranty is limited to 150 dollars. Anything above that - they offer you to contact the seller through their system and you are supposed to be copied on that. The system does not work that way as confirmed by their reps and although the reps promise you to contact the seller they do not take responsibility if he does not answer you - big legal loophole deliberately made by their lawyers. So you can call as many times as you want the Walmart reps (all with Indian accent) and they promise you to contact the seller and you are never copied on that (although they promise you to do so) and the circle goes on with call confirmation numbers, escalation, supervisors and so on until you give up your money to them.

Don't shop much at Walmart because of their poor service. The other day I gave it another try. My cell phone went on the blink so I needed another one. I told the salesman that I just needed a phone without a plan, that I wanted to pay for it outright and that I wanted a low end phone. He told me that they don't sell phones like that. After I told him that they do, according to their web site, he took me to the most expensive phones, with plans, and I repeatedly said No. Finally after I got irritated and started to walk away he had the phone I wanted. Upon my insistence he changed over the SIM card, put the phone in my hand and walked away. I filed a complaint with Walmart Customer service ""How Did We Do Today"" and all I got back was an inappropriate computer generated response which did not address the issue.

3/4 Tier Slim Slide Out Trolley Storage Holder Rack Organiser Kitchen Bathroom Mobile Shelving with Rolling Castors, White/Grey, 2QA4M2HJYK9P.

* I am very disappointed with this whole online ordering process.
* I never realized that the 3/4 in the description meant that you were either going to receive a 3 or a 4 tier which are 2 different sizes.
* When I received the item and opened the box, after assembly, there was an extra set of poles but no fourth tier, so I called to see if I could be sent the extra missing tier that it seemed that I was missing. However, for the smaller trolley size that I received, it is only supposed to have 3 tiers... Walmart/China just automatically send you 4 extra poles for the fourth tier whether you are getting the 3 or 4 tier version of the trolley!
* So what am I supposed to do with the extra 4 poles that I received?! What a waste! This experience just further discourages me from ordering online as it is just creating more waste. It is absolutely shameful!
* Also, what kind of way is this to place an order with a customer? If I had received the fourth tier, it would not have fit or worked in the area that I needed it for since the size of the 4 tier version is much larger. It was just luck that I received the 3 tier instead of the 4 tier! If I had received the 4 tier, I would have had to send the product back!

At the self checkout, upon presenting the coupon to the associate, my mother and I were asked if we took the coupon from the product shelf. We were extremely embarrassed, because the associate was basically accusing us of stealing. A 5$ coupon is not worth our integrity and dignity. When we pointed out to the associate that I was purchasing two jars (one with the coupon, the other at regular price) as well as items that were worth more, she gaslit us saying that it is common for people to steal the coupons. She looked at us, two Black women, and automatically thought we were stealing and refused to apologize after being proven wrong. I work in retail and yes, while it is common for people to steal items, one of the very first things we're taught in training is to report any suspicious behaviour to a supervisor instead of direct confrontation. Instead of that, this associate chose to accuse us of stealing based on the negative stereotypes of Black people. I reported her to her supervisor but was left unsatisfied with his response.

I am left to figure out what happened to the disappearing necklaces.

Something appears rather fishy. The tracking info was stuck on Dec 15 being the last day of activity for about 2 weeks. Two days ago, while at home, an email came in from Canada Post at 2.31 pm advising the package is delivered. I live on a condo with concierge at front desk. I went down to the letterbox at 3.52 pm, and did not see any package. Other persons were present. I showed the concierge the arrival notice I got from Canada Post, and ask him if there was any possibility that Canada Post left the package with him, he said no, and understandably so. If the package cannot hold in the letterbox, a note is left on the letterbox directing the recipient to a

post office to collect, or a key is left in the letterbox giving access to Canada DropBox to retrieve the package. None of this occurred.

So after paying over $130.00, I got nothing.

We ordered a bike online on Dec 7th, and prior to ordering the bike they said they had in-stock we called to make sure it would be delivered before xmas for our son, otherwise we wouldnt have ordered it. They told us they ""guaranteed"" it would be by the 20th, even sending us an email saying so. The 20th came and no bike, we called and they told us theyd ""escalate it"" for the next day. We called again on the 21st, no bike, they told us theyd ""escalate it"" again (which is just what they say to get us off of the phone). 22nd came no bike, they told us they were so sorry but the 24th for sure, the 24th came and no bike. On that day they told us so sorry but it will be for sure by the 28th, which already meant our son had no gift for xmas now. The 28th came and no bike. They told us again theyd ""escalate it"". Today is the 30th and still no bike, not only that they say they have no idea where it is today and cant help us, the CS rep actually told us to start calling different locations to see if we could locate it???. When my wife told her how stupid that is that Customer Service wants US to track down a product that WE paid for almost 4 weeks ago based on HER companies guarantee, she hung up on us. This company obviously either sold us something they didnt have in the first place, or sold our sons bike to someone else after taking our order. If this is how your ridiculous company wants to operate 11 months a year go ahead, but you dont do this to people at xmas time. With all the small shops going out of business while you, Wal-Mart, stay open lying to people and basically ripping them off, I am embarrassed for you.

Examples:
- Getting an email notification one day after the order was placed that the item is not available. Thanks for wasting my time.
- Then, if you want to cancel the rest of your order, you can't. Customer service was powerless as well.
- Exchanging an item in store is not allowed because, apparently, the Walmart online and the Walmart brick-and-mortar store are two distinct entities. Also, for exact same item, prices may be different between online and physical stores.
- Ordered to pick-up in store. But the item never arrives to the store. My order just fell through one of Walmart's many cracks. Thanks for wasting my time.
- Site keeps asking to click on checkbox to confirm I am a human. Then, it takes several seconds to load the page. Thanks for wasting my time.
- Bad site design. E.g.: When hovering the cursor over a sidebar item in Account Info, a box would highlight the selection but if you left-click, nothing happens. You must hover over the TEXT. This is amateur web designer mistake.
- Item page would sometimes says it's available, sometimes not, depending on the path you took to end up on that item's page. In-store inventory is also buggy and unreliable.

Walmart.ca customer service is the absolute worst! I wanted to buy my son a new bike for Christmas but unfortunately am on a tight budget so thought I found a good one at Walmart for a price I could afford. However, I received a notification a day later that my order was cancelled. CS couldn't explain why but recommended I put the order through again... So I did, and it showed that it would arrived for pick up at my local store by December 20th. Perfect! But then when I checked out it said the 28th... So I immediately went to CS to explain that I needed it before Christmas and it initially said that it would be the 20th. They said nothing helpful just to wait and see what the email said when the item was shipped. They said my order could not be cancelled as I was thinking to cancel and try to find a bike elsewhere. The next day I got the email saying the bike was ""on its way"" and the pick up date would be December 20th. So on the 20th, I have not received notification and when I check the tracking it shows that it is NOT on its way at all, only that a shipping label has been generated. CS says they are not sure why it is not on its way, and they don't know where it is even. You don't know where your products come from??????? So they put in a ticket and promise I will be called back in 2 days with an update. On the 24th I call again, and they say oh on our end it says the pick up date is the 28th, and they can't explain why my email says BY the 20th. So they do nothing until the 28th despite me calling everyday and putting tickets in. ON the 28th, I call again and the bike is still sitting where ever... only a shipping label generated and not actually on the move anywhere, as my first email indicated. They say they will put in another ticket and expedite it, more lies and scripted responses that are completely useless and they have no answers or willingness to do anything that will actually locate the bike and get it to my store! I would be willing to drive to pick it up where ever even but why would the store selling the item know where it is coming from????? Completely ridiculous and useless, it feels like I was sold a product that they didn't actually have and are just giving me the runaround until maybe another shipment comes in or something. Will not even let me cancel. I would strongly advise anyone considering a purchase from Walmart.ca to look elsewhere as they make it very clear they do not care one bit about the customer experience or satisfaction, or even providing them with the product they purchase anywhere near the time frame they say they will.

I waited for my refund and it never came.

It may be a nit pick but they really need to be more transparent about that on their website.  You have to wade through the grocery FAQ section in order to find that information.  It just feels like a bait and switch.Remember that old rule in customer service.  If a customer has a good experience, she will tell a few people.

They will blatantly lie to you an example is my order from Dec 5 2020 they tell me canpar lost my package but the Walmart tracking says it was never picked up. No call to explain what happened just an email that says you have been reimbursed. Tried to call to see what happened 1st call disconnected, 2nd call hung up on 3rd call given attitude. Says so much for this company. Feels like everyone should boycott Walmart and find other local companies and support them instead of the large company with no face that doesn't care how people are treated as long as they make the sale.

I would rank it negative stars if I could.  I am avoiding any in store shopping because of Covid. I checked stock and when I placed the order on Dec 16, they said pick-up would be ready Dec 17. I did not get any notice, so I logged into my account on Dec 18 to track the status.  The system came up and said ""status not available"" please contact us. After waiting for an hour on hold, the person said I would get a ""notification"" when it was ready. I said I wanted to cancel the order because I needed the product on the 17th and would get it elsewhere. I was told it was too late to cancel the order. I said how can that be if it has not ""shipped"", which I presume is from one store to another because I placed a curb side pickup order. She said it had now shopped and it would be ready approx Dec 25th!!!  Are you kidding me? I asked to speak to a manager, I was put on hold for another hour and had to give up, that must be the way they treat people who disagree with their blatantly illegal business practices.  I will not shop at Walmart again and intend to take this further to the better business bureau!",2020-12-20

December 9th has come and passed. There was no tracking info, every time I contact customer service it's the same word for word statement, ""we will escalate the issue, please allow 24-48 hours for a reply"" no reply comes, repeat this process over and over.

Its been over two weeks now since the original pickup date and since they took the money. Got a email yesterday saying sorry your package is delayed again please allow 4 - 6 business days; guess I should just accept that the item will not be here in time for the holidays.

Thus they have to also accept responsibility for those they let sell on their site! Here is my story;I wanted to give some feedback on my first online order with a third party through Wal-Mart. First, it was placed on November 14, 2021 but the company waited a full two weeks to ship the order on November 28, 2021. The order barely arrived on time for me to get the gifts under the tree in my classroom before our Christmas break. A two week delay in shipping is simply unacceptable. I ordered 24 RC cars and 23 worked which is a 96% success rate. Luckily I had ordered an extra car, so no harm done with having a car that wouldn't run. I just returned the other to Wal-Mart and hopefully I will get a refund. I additionally asked the company on November 14th to ship 3 RC Cars of the eight different frequencies available and the company agreed. Then only 3 frequencies were shipped instead of the eight. This led to some chaos in the gym with multiple cars interfering with each other. This could have been drastically reduced if the company had shipped the eight frequencies as agreed upon. Once again totally unacceptable. If the company could not have filled the request then they should have said so at the time. I find their business practices very questionable and severely lacking and I am sorry but I can not leave a positive review even though the students loved the gifts.    Sincerely, Paul",2020-12-19

Wow what a sad policy. Walmart is Walmart to inconvenience your customer when trying your online shopping. Especially when item is sold damaged on arrival.

2 to 3 business days to get my refund is unacceptable.

I have order from other stores who refund your online item without a hassel.

I ordered 3 LOL bigger suprises for daughters for christmas on a black friday sale for their big gifts for Christmas.

I got notification that my order was ready. So I went to pick it up and it was 2 LOL OMG barbie. The store was refusing to keep the package even though i had an email stating i picked up 3 LOL bigger suprises which was not in the package. After 3 employees, finally the assistant store manager came out and agreed to keep the package on her office as it was incorrect and advised me to call customer service.

I called customer service a week ago and they said they would escalate my complaint to a manager. They would contact me within 2 business days. Nobody contacted me. I called TUESDAY and they said buy them online regular price after they still have my money for the first 3 and we will credit the difference. I said bo that makes no sense. They trasferred me to management. I waited for over an hour and nobody picked up. So I hung up.

I reached out again this morning via online chay and thet advised they would escalate it further and i would for sure be contacted today.

AGAIN, nobody contacted so I went to the online chat around 5 and they said they will send another message and escalate again. Still have not heard anything and it is reaching the ens od the day.

So I now have no big christmas gifts for my kids and walmart has my money still. Nobody is dealing with it and I am extremely frustrated with Walmarts customer service. They do not care about their customer experience and their customer service is very very poor.

https://ca.trustpilot.com/users/5c2e76f13da9c33d2fddb13a,1,Worst customer service EVER!,"On 21 October I made a purchase from Walmart.ca. I received no e-mail confirmation, so the next day I called Walmart’s customer service and was told that they had not received any order in my name. I therefore ordered the item again. I still received no confirmation, but a couple of days later the item was delivered. Next day I received an e-mail telling me that my order had been shipped, and needless to say, a couple of days later, the item was delivered for the SECOND time! On Walmart's website I learned that because the purchase was from a third-party seller, I had to contact the seller. I did this, but got no response. Eventually, after I’d called Walmart several times, they got the seller to send me a return shipping label but the seller said I had to pay the shipping costs. Since this whole issue was the result of Walmart’s error, I objected, and after another couple of calls to Walmart I found somebody who agreed to send money to cover my shipping costs. He sent me an e-mail while I was still on the phone confirming this, and the money was credited to my credit card the same day. I therefore returned the item and on 18 November I received an e-mail from Walmart confirming that a refund had been approved. However, the price I had paid was specified correctly as $164.92, but the amount I was being refunded was only $114.92. I called and pointed this out and was asked to wait until the amount had come into my account. I did, and it was of course wrong. I have since then been trying to get Walmart to refund the difference, $56.50 ($50 plus HST), and I am still waiting to receive this money. On 2 December I was told that the refund had been approved on 27 November but that the amount could take up to 5 business days to show up on my card. Nothing happened, so on 10 December I called again and was told that it could take up to 10 business days. It is now 12 business days since the amount was supposed to have been sent, and I have yet to see it. To date, I have had to call Walmart 20 times and have been told at least 4 times that the issue has been escalated to the finance department, who will contact me in 2-3 days. This NEVER happens, and I now realise that Walmart are lying to me, as they have done repeatedly. They have not approved a refund, and have no intention of doing so. I have no way of finding out why not, because I am not allowed to talk to anybody in the finance department. I can only talk to customer service (presumably in India), where they know nothing about the matter. I now immediately ask to be put through to a supervisor, but even these cannot help. They say they can’t see why the money hasn’t come into my account, and that they will escalate the issue and I will hear from them – in 2-3 days!

This is the worst customer service I have EVER experienced. It’s not much comfort to know that I’m clearly not alone. I will NEVER buy anything from Walmart.ca again and if I can avoid it, I will never again set foot in a Walmart store.",2020-12-15

Received part of the order on October 7th.  Order missing 3 balls of yarn according to the order sheet and 3 balls of yarn were not even what I ordered. I phoned walmart ... more yarn still to come ... no worries and they issued me a return email to take wrong yarn to canada post for return.  Decided to wait to see if rest of shipment would show. Received rest of items but no missing yarn, called Wal-Mart issued a refund for missing yarn on October 15th. Other yarn received was from 3rd party items and overpriced so returned to Wal-Mart store on November 3rd. Received refunds right away. They would not take other 3 balls of yarn because refund was issued for only Canada post return... what nonsense. Canada post delivered yarn on November 9th and suppose to get refund as soon as received.  No refund ... phoned november 18th ... will investigate.. should be resolved in 3 days.  No refund .. phoned on November 24th... sorry this has now been escalated 2-3 days for resolution.  Phoned December 9th ... what refund... your returned yarn doesn't match our tracking number .. what the hell... we will escalate this... 2-3 days. All of this for $31 .... so pissed off and now it is the principle of this return and Wal-Mart being okay with ripping people off.  BBB is next for resolution.

It's like amazon, without any of the benefits of amazon.

My story - ordered a monitor on black friday for Christmas. They shipped the outright wrong item. The wrong item shipped clearly shows CUISNART on its box.

Trying to return it is an absolute horror show. The call center is outsourced and is barely understandable and just say ""we are sorry this happened to you"" then do nothing.

My stages of expectations:
1) I cannot get shipped a new item, I cannot purchase the original item again at the original price. Told nothing can do
2) Another person told me they can escalate it. So I did. No response after 5 days.
3) Requesting a simple refund, told I can return to the store or mail. Call Store, no I cannot.
4) Look at the return request, does not mention wrong item anywhere. Just a bunch of Canada post information. NO refund issue until they receive the item...... but how do they receive a monitor I don't have?

I'm currently debating if it's worth it to go through the charge back process or throw this package into the wind.

Order confirmation indicated December 3 as expected delivery which was updated to December 2nd. I called Customer Service when it wasn’t delivered on that day and noticed late that same day updated info was shipment delayed until December 4. December 4 update showed still delayed. I called Customer Service wanting to know why the delay and real expected delivery. They could not provide an answer even when I escalated to supervisor. I requested a refund and that said I’d have to wait and refuse delivery, this is not acceptable in that Walmart cannot provide this information and obviously cannot deliver. I was given this e mail address to facilitate my refund request. I can readily buy this item at Best Buy and London Drugs for the same Walmart Online Price! I need my refund in order to do so. Please provide ASAP as this is a Christmas Gift.
Just be aware I shop at Walmart all the time and this relationship is now in jeopardy because of this very unsatisfactory experience. I feel the information provided at time of purchase is misleading including tracking information that indicated the item had been shipped to me and delivery is pending. Follow up with Customer service suggests otherwise as you have no inventory and are awaiting shipment from supplier. Very disappointing. Please process my refund request as soon as possible.

We opened it yesterday night ready to trim the tree. When we opened the box it was not the tree with the white branches and it did not contain a tree stand as stated.
I called that walmart they did not have any of the frisco tree left. When then called another Walmart at 10 pm and was told they had only a couple left. It was already ten and asked if they could put one aside for us for the exchange and we would pick it up in the morning. The customer service agent said she could only hold it till 11pm that same night. We explained we could not be there in less than an hour and would be there first thing in the morning. We also explained that the kids had pickd the tree out and our plan had been to set the tree up that night and surprise them by letting them decorate it in the morning. This is a hard year for all and its the little things that get us through. We explained this to her and she still refused. It was only until I asked to speak to the supervisor that she then put me on hold it is now 10:20 pm. After many minutes she returned on the phone and said she would put it behind customer service desk and I could pick it up the next day but if not there by noon they would return it to the floor. Her voice was very abrupt and rude. But it gets even better...So new day we go to exchange our tree perfectly packaged and taped in the morning. The customer service rep was not only NOT friendly or approchable but with an attitude that seemed we were bothering her. We were the only ones at the customer service desk and she seemed very disconcerned as we explained about the tree. Her response to us was ""well that has never happened before"" she actually looked at us as if what we were saying was not true. Her customer service skills were non apparent and very unfriendly. When we did the exchange we asked if she could open the new box so we could verify everything was there. This seemed to annoy her and be a waste of her time. When she opened the box for us Lo and Behold there was the tree stand on top and the tree was completley white on the branches. The tree we had originally thought we were buying in the first place. We asked if she could tape up the box so we could carry it out, again it was an inconvience. So whoever packed the tree put in the wrong one and also did not put in the stand.
Our experience was not one that will be repeated again. If this agent had done her job properly as in the title of customer service this would of been a simple exchange. We were already disappointed and not happy about having to do the exchange when a moment had been ruined already. We were never rude or hostile however I can't say the same about your rep. If she does not like dealing with people who were nice and understanding maybe she should rethink about being in customer service.

https://ca.trustpilot.com/users/5fb7e02f4fe0b9001918bc25,1,Consistent Gross Incompetence from Walmart Customer Service,"I am reviewing Walmart Canada grocery delivery service. One star is too generous but this site doesn't give me the option to give Walmart a -10 so one-star it is. By the way, this is not the first time this very thing happened with Walmart grocery delivery. First of all, they have by far THE ABSOLUTE WORST MOST INCOMPETENT customer service on the planet!

So I placed a grocery order that was to be delivered between 10-11 am this morning. It's now 10:15am and the order hasn't even been picked, so obviously it's not going to arrive anywhere near the pre-booked time. I have other things to do outside my home so I have to be out of here no later than noon.

So because the order hasn't shipped because it hasn't even been picked yet, I contact customer service and ask them to please cancel it - I won't be home if and when they get around to MAYBE delivering it sometime later today. The agent can barely speak English - had trouble understanding her - she kept telling me that she's sorry but it's too late to cancel the order and to wait until the end of the day and if it doesn't arrive by then, it will be automatically cancelled. I'm like WHAT???!!

So I calmly and politely explain again that I won't be home the rest of the day and since it's their fault, not mine, and the order hasn't even been picked, OF COURSE IT CAN BE CANCELLED!

She then tells me that it hasn't yet been picked because payment didn't go through. So I say, ""Well then there's no problem cancelling it, right?"" to which she says, ""No, it can't be cancelled, please wait until the end of the day."" Again I repeat I won't be here. She then says it's okay if I won't be home because the driver will just leave it at my door... um, no, I have frozen things in there AND I live in a building which doesn't have security or a concierge so that won't work.

I checked and payment went through the day I placed my order so why is she telling me it didn't?

So we went around in circles, with her repeating her obviously scripted responses. So I ended the chat with her and called Walmart instead. That customer service rep told me the exact same thing, word for word, obviously she too reading from a script.

UNBELIEVABLE the level of gross incompetence from Walmart's customer service agents. And is it too much to ask Walmart to hire customer service agents who speak English well enough to be understood? Or is that not politically correct?

I am never ordering grocery delivery from Walmart again because while they are cheaper than just about anywhere else, the stress they put their customers through isn't worth it. I'd rather pay more to have grocery delivered but have it all go smoothly and delivered on time - and if there is a problem have it resolved quickly and professionally - than to put up with Walmart's gross incompetence.

LOL and just as I was writing that last sentence, my groceries arrived.... while I'm still on hold on the phone with the THIRD customer service rep who is putting me through to her supervisor at my request. She won't, they never do, at some point the call will just disconnect. That's the games they play.

UNBELIEVABLE that the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing at Walmart.

EDIT: Two hours after they delivered my groceries, they sent a text informing me that my order is on its way.

2nd EDIT: I requested a refund for some items because some of the produce was absolute garbage, other things were expired or about to expire, etc., totaling $15 and change. The following day I get an email from Walmart stating that my refund of $0.00 for the ""Startfrit Rock Pan"" which was a pan I had purchased from them TWO years ago which arrived shattered into a million pieces because they just threw the ceramic pan in the box without wrapping it with bubble wrap or something - and they refunded my money two years ago. UNbelievable!

Have I said how consistently grossly incompetent Walmart Customer Service is? This point can't be stated enough.

I received a bill showing a total amount of $ 153.32, which included overcharging for potatoes ($ 26.64 for 1.37 Kg), onions, pear anjou, chinese eggplant and oranges (5 produce items)
But my credit card has been charged a sum of $ 163.04, which is completely different
I made a complaint with Adam on the same day, physically showed him the wrong billing, who promised to resolve it by speaking to a Manager Anish Trehan by next day
He spoke to me next day (yesterday) over phone and on his request I sent the bill I received by eMail. He spoke to me again after about one hour and gave me a phone number (1 800 328 0402) for me to speak to and said that they would resolve it (he gave some reasons for it which I do not want to stress here)
He also told me that there was a 'system glitch' in the billing on that day and that he would make sure that I would not be charged for any of the 'produce' at all in this bill
I spoke to the above given number immediately (yesterday) and they promised to call me in 1 hour.
Right now when I am writing this, it has passed more than 1 day and nobody has spoken to me.
From the responses I have received so far, I do not know whether Walmart accept the fact that I need to know 'my bill' item by item (including the weight etc)
Further I later realized that although I originally ordered; a) 2 chicken thighs it has been changed to 1 and I have been charged for 2 and b) 2 onions changed to 1 onion though I had been charged for 2. Walmart can see this from you own eMail sent by you as below.
In spite of the promises, I am still to get the, 1) bill on my pick-up order on Oct. 09 and, 2)the credits arising out of it due to wrong billing by Walmart as explicitly explained in my below message and agreed by Walmart Manager Anish Trehan during our telephonic discussions and Walmart eMail as quoted in my below message. .
I cannot understand what is happening here and the way how Walmart consider ""customer service"", astonishing!
many eMail correspondences has been passed on from 'pillar to post' and I have no solutions yet to:
credit due to me on overcharged amount (5 produce items over charged (example $ 26.64 for 1.37 kg potatoes) + 2 items removed from my order)
promised credit by Walmart Deerfoot Meadows Calgary Manager Anish Trehan (not to charge for any of the produce on the bill)
not received a proper bill for what my credit card had been charged (on pick-up order of Oc. 9, a week ago.
not a single telephone call as promised at different times by many Walmart employees.
Yet another unattended ""promise"" after 4 days (96 hours) had passed, but with no reply, by the time I am writing this message.
If this is the way Walmart treats its customers (record of my purchases from Walmart is all available to Walmart) and make money out of customers by wrong billing, I have no words to express.
I now consider it as a debt I have taken in a past life (Samsara) from Walmart owners and I am happy now I have now settled it and no more debts to settle!
May be, I am treated like this because, my orders are very small for Walmart, but I am a poor person who buys only what is affordable to me.

This woman (Greeter) completely refused to make me feel more comfortable with shopping at such a busy store during such a devastating time in the world. I ended up taking out my bags of sanitary wipes that I was lucky enough to have in my purse and managed to wipe down what I could on my cart and I then proceed to go in to Walmart and get what I needed and get out and as I was leaving I asked the (Greeter for her name and she covered up her name tag while refusing to tell me what her name was arguing with me the whole time and being very ignorant to me and I then told her that I wanted her name to report her ignorance and her lack of compassion for others and to my surprise along with my Girlfriend the (Greeter) then said to me that IF I REPORTED HER SHE WOULD F@#KING SMASH ME and I was just going to leave it alone because I was starting to feel very sick from the situation and by the way this GREETER treated me my girlfriend made sure that I talked to management instead and report this woman's attitude. I had 2 other employees helping me out with finding a manager and after about 15 minutes of waiting a manager did finally show up and my girlfriend and I could feel that this manager was pissed off that she had to listen to my girlfriend and I explained to her what had happened and to my surprise she really didn't seem to care at all. I honestly expected the manager to apologize for her employee and tell me that this would be handled appropriately but instead I didn't get any response except for her making me feel like I've taken up her valuable time!! I have never felt so insulted in my entire life from a WALMART GREETER AND A WALMART MANAGER!!!! As my girlfriend and I were leaving the store again we had to walk by customer service only to be given nothing but dirty looks from the staff as we noticed that the pissed off manager and the GREETER were gathered around a bunch of other employees and believe me, the employees Definitely made it clear that I was nothing but a problem. What a damn Shame that Walmart allows people like this GREETER AND MANAGER with a rotten ignorant disposition to be employed, I say get another job if you don't know how to treat others with some respect. Working with the public isn't for everyone and this GREETER Definitely needs to find another job that she would fit into and NOT WORK WITH THE PUBLIC!!!! I completely understand what it's like to work with the public being a retired Bartender/Waitress after 30yrs and if you can't be nice to others then DON'T WORK WITH OTHERS!!!! So to the head management/ owners of Walmart, I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED WITH SOME OF YOUR STAFF AND I WILL""NEVER EVER"" SHOP IN YOUR STORE AGAIN AT ARGYLE MALL CLARK AND DUNDAS LONDON ONTARIO CANADA!!!!
Signed one PISSED OFF DISAPPOINTED CUSTOMER!!😠🤬😠🤬 Oh and I asked the manager what she was going to do about this situation but she didn't bother to answer me so I then proceed to say, well I guess I should be calling the police because your employee had threatened me then and she literally came across like she really didn't give a crap and really didn't say a damn word to me except for, yeah sure ok!!! And she then walked away without saying one word to me!! Unbelievable!!!! Way to go Walmart at Argyle mall!!!
As of today a day later after hearing how I was treated at this Walmart I now know so many people along with my friends and family who will not be using this one Walmart store anymore. Word of mouth actually does work and it works very well!!!

I'M HONESTLY WONDERING HOW MANY OTHERS WERE THREATENED AS WELL FROM THIS SO CALLED WALMART GREETER?????

The laptop's screen was unreadable and it worked for 15 minutes total. The charging cord didn't seem to work so I bought a new one. The laptop powered up for 5 minutes, then the screen went black and it doesn't power up whatever I try.

I received the package on August 18 from Upgrade Stations. On August 21 I initiated a return with Walmart. They said they'd contact the third party seller (Gadget Plus). That company (both Canadian and US versions) deny they are involved with Walmart. Upgrade Stations don't return calls or answer emails. They actually did once after my first contact to ask for the tracking number which I gave them. They never followed up or answered any of my emails.

Walmart Canada are washing their hands in this matter altough everything went though their online store, nothing to do with the third party's. The lady I spoke with today at customer service even yelled at me.

I was notified by Walmart that the item was shipped and that it had arrived at the pick up point, but it said to wait for a notification to pick the item up, as the pick up point receives many items and they need to be processed. After constantly checking back with no notification, I went to the Penguin Pickup to ask about my delivery and was told it was sent back to the warehouse because it had been there for two weeks. I told them about not being notified and they said that that happens often with Walmart, which is something that needs to be fixed. After speaking with Walmart customer service, they said I would have to be refunded and re-order the dresser online if I still wanted it. It has been over 2 months and I have still not been refunded. I have spoke with four customer service agents who tell me the same thing every time and they say that someone will reach out to be within 48 hours to let me know the status of my refund, yet I have never been contacted and I am still out $214.

Order 1: Receiving a gift from family member: A bassinet for the new baby (yet to come!) Waiting for the online order to arrive. Got notification that it was not delivered because the driver could not find the location. Called in UPS and confirmed address and exact intersection and instructions on how to get to the front door (it's a regular house, not complicated).

Two days later we get confirmation it's been delivered. Ummmm, the package is not here. Called back, and they realized they delivered to an entirely different address; the address wasn't even REMOTELY close in resemblance. How do you make that mistake? Anyway, they said they will speak to UPS and investigate. Talked to UPS, they said, whoops we delivered to wrong place so just talk to Walmart directly. And so we did, once, twice, three times.... 10 times. Every time, same situation ""We're expediting it and you should hear in 2-10 business days (they gave a different business day count every time).

MY wife was so stressed by this time because she is pregnant and close to due date and the item is a BASSINET FOR THE BABY. She doesn't need this kind of stress. She actually cried on the phone. They gave a lousy 10$ voucher. One of the agents actually had the audacity to ask for a good review in the phone survey. Needless to say we gave a very real survey feedback. Finally after 10+ calls we said just give the gifter a refund and we'll take our business elsewhere.

Order 2: Ordered a stroller set. It got lost in transit. Made many calls to resolve the issue. Kept getting the run around. Finally they said they escalated the issue and will call me in 24-48 hours. No calls for 5 days. I get an email saying I've been issued a refund. Confused, I call back and they said item was lost so they refunded me. Well, I didn't ask for a refund.

I told her that i just spoke to Roman earlier on the phone and he said that they have 2 on hand.
I saw Roman just as he was about to go on his break, he said that they got sold out.

And these items don’t even appear anymore online at all.  I complained to PayPal as well and when they investigated, were told I received the delivery.

Placing the order was very easy and fast.Due to the fact that I entered the incorrect email address I had to call customer service. My call was answered promptly to a friendly customer service representative who was able to quickly correct my information. After placing the order I realized the dining chair image on the Walmart website was different from the item description. Image showed a chrome chair frame (which I wanted) item description was a black metal chair frame. So I was not sure which one I would receive. Surprised and quite happy with delivery of the order, it arrived a day earlier than promised . I received it 5 days after I placed the order. Chairs turned out to be black metal which is okay, since these are extra addition to the same chairs I already have with chrome finish. The chairs are very good quality for the low price. The only reason I did not give an 8 star rating is because of the confusion with the image not matching item description. These were chairs bought and sold by Walmart which is probably why online or and delivery went so smoothly.",2020-08-12

Most importantly, the cleanliness of this particular store is really well below standards.  What happened to ""deep cleaning""?  You don't even do proper surface cleaning.  I was in the store last Saturday and the bathrooms were absolutely filthy with urine on the floors, no paper towels, just loose rolls placed on counters.  I went to Customer Service but there was no one there.  When I commented on Facebook on the Mono group, many  many people responded to complain about the Orangeville store.

https://ca.trustpilot.com/users/5f2d93e3a8a41cc67aa9819b,1,Delivery was wrong product and refused to send correct one,"Okay, I'm actually wondering if Walmart Canada is a legitimate thing or if Walmart doesn't support it, as if it's a fake website.

I ordered off their site around a month ago. It was my first time, and only. So I ordered a light blue insulated delivery bag so I could do deliveries with Uber eats. This delivery bag was advertised with multiple photos, all showing that the bag is equal to the size of a large Skipthedishes bag. A bag that would be big enough to carry multiple food orders in, with a strap on it etc, it also had a review from one costumer who said she got what she asked for.

Walmart lets me put in my credentials, they accept it, I get a confirmation email that my order was sent, that my order was being shipped blah blah blah. A week after the expected arrival date, I get an email saying the package has arrived, but it wasn't there. I ordered it to my house. I went to the post office to give them the tracking number (which luckily worked since I hear other people had an issue with tracking #), and the post office said it was dropped off at my mail box. I thought to myself, ""a big insulated delivery bag should be too large to be in my mail slot.....right?"" I ended up getting the package and it was tiny, embarrassingly tiny.

I was expecting exactly what I saw in the pictures, when I opened it, it was a dark blue pencil case. I email Walmart and the costumer service is like, ""nah man sorry, you'll have to take this problem up with TradeWoo yourself"".

TRAAAADEWOOOO! I don't like these guys. They're a chinese manufacture company or whatever they really are. They tried to beat around the bush 3 times, offering me a $6 refund for me to shutup, even though I paid $36 for it. They then sent another email basically saying the same thing, but they sent me a photo of their dimensions and wanted me to take full photos of the SKU number and all the dimension I got. I was 100% they knew they sent me a pencil case, but I chose to take those photos for them to show that this little thing was smaller then a ruler and couldn't even fit a water bottle.

Now they're just ignoring me for abit, I think they might reply eventually but who knows really, they might just breeze this off like they do with many other costumers. I ain't taking a $6 settlement fee, screw that. I've told them twice, ""simply ship to me what was advertised in the photos of the product and what I paid for"", and they're beating around the bush.

Surprised Walmart does business with these scam artists. Surprised they've gotten me so mad I had to write this.

I'm pretty sure this is a done cause and I won't get my product. They even told me I have to pay for shipping again if I want to send back my wrong product, you can only imagine what I might have to pay for again if I want them to ship me what I had ordered. Knowing them, they'll ask me to make a re purchase, pretending like everything's already gone through their system and like they'd need a new order placement to begin the shipping process blah blah blah ""give us your money"". You go to their website and it's all chinese which I'm expecting but it also said ""Bang goods"" at the top so to me it seems a little bit like a joke, like they're scamming people.

To add to that, I saw a review that one of the Tradewoo employees made secondary purchases off of a persons card information, so I'm scared about that in a way.

Don't order from Walmart.ca, go Amazon, and if you see TradeWoo, cancel if you still have time.",2020-08-07

4. You go to your choice of grocery stores in-person.

Walmart.ca isn't helpful in solving problems for its customers like ""where is my item?"".
Walmart.ca hides its contact information deep within some web page to discourage customers from contacting it.
Emailing Walmart.ca about an issue will only generate an automatic email with no option to reply.
Calling Walmart.ca requires multiple call backs.
This is my case: I bought a third party item from Walmart.ca and got a confirmation email from Walmart.ca that items is ON THE MOVE and estimated ARRIVAL is in 3 weeks. Now, it is 10 weeks and 3-4 phone calls to Walmart.ca to refund my money. Walmart.ca couldn't get an answer from its own third party supplier either. Now Walmart.ca keeps saying the item is still ""on the way"" and the estimated arrival date keeps being pushed back a couple of more weeks.
If this was Amazon, I could have cancelled my order and refunded my money with click of a button with no pain.

May 7, 2020 - Ordered online 50 masks and 100 gloves.
Delivery dates, by Jun 8, 2020, for the masks, by Jun 12, 2020, for the gloves
May 9, 2020 - Credit card charged $107 by Walmart for both products, Email received from Walmart indicated the products has been shipped
June 8, 2020 - no confirmation email sent to indicate the masks were ready for pickup, they were now late.
Jun 12, 2020 - received a confirmation email that the gloves were ready for pickup at the requested Walmart store location, up until Jun 18
Jun 12, 2020 - I called Walmart Canada to inquire about the masks that were supposed to arrive 4 days prior; I was told to send an email to the 3rd party shipping company to track the masks; I obtained the address through the Walmart website. I was supposed to receive a response the next day and never received one
Jun 13, 2020 - I went to pick up the gloves at the Walmart store, was brought the package an in the package were actually the masks and not the gloves. (order mix up) The store checked if there were any other packages for me and there weren't any. He store agent and myself assumed that the gloves were delayed as the masks were, so I gave it a few days
June 20, 2020 - I called Walmart Canada 7 days later as I still had not received the gloves. I was told that there was a 'delay' at the border, give it another two weeks. I requested a cancellation of the order for the gloves and to have cost for the gloves credited back to my credit cards account. The agent informed that he would submit a ticket for the refund and that I would receive an email notification in 5 business days to confirm the refund was being processed...I never received any notification
Jun 29, 2020 - I called Walmart 'Canada' (all the agents are based out of the United States), and spoke to another agent to find out about the status of my refund. I was told that the ticket was closed because I had received my masks!! I informed her that, as I told the agent/rep I spoke to on Jun 20, 2020, there was a mix up in the order tracking and although the original issue was with the delay in receiving the masks, I ended receiving them, instead of the gloves that I was informed had been delivered. I requested an escalation, to speak to a supervisor or manage; was advised that I would receive a call or email within 72 hours; I never received one.
It has been 8 weeks since I purchased gloves and masks through Walmart's online ordering system and I still do not have the gloves or have been refunded the money/ cost of purchase. My next step is to file a complaint with Consumer's Protection.",2020-07-04
https://ca.trustpilot.com/users/5eff90fd338d69bf634b555e,1,Walmart online is horrible and customer service is worse.,"I ordered a LEGO set from a 3rd party seller on May 29th.

Walmart charged my card the next day, the item came from the United States, which I didn’t know it would be coming from since I ordered from Walmart.ca

I had it ordered to the store on silver linden in Richmond hill since that was my only option.

I kept tracking the item on Walmart’s website and which is garbage and doesn’t give you any real information.

It finally said delivered to pick up location, so I called the store and the lady was extremely rude and said I had to wait for an email from Walmart to come get it. So I called customer service and they could not tell me if the item was at the store or not or the tracking number and to contact the 3rd party seller. I contacted them and they were super nice and helpful. Got back to me immediately and said to call usps, and gave me the tracking number to track my item.

USPS said it’s in Canada so to call Canada post which I did and finally I tracked down the item at a Canada post location not at the Walmart. I went to the Canada post location and the lady was super confused as to why it had my name but Walmart’s address so I explained the situation to her and showed her my email receipt from Walmart she said she had never seen something so messed up, why would they put my name but there address, plus Canada post doesn’t deliver to Walmart. She gave me the item since I could prove i paid for it then she told me I had to pay customs fees for my item.

I ordered it from a Canadian website, and was never told it was coming from the states or that I would be required to pay customs. I only found out once the item was shipped.

I called customer service again to complain about the customs fee and the representative was useless, so he escalated my complaint. They are supposed to email me tomorrow but after reading these reviews I am not confident that I will hear back from them.

The 3rd party seller was the only professional company, I would buy from them again but not through Walmart.

I did not expect such a big retail brand to have such lousy online service. You've fooled me once, but not again Walmart online.

An item was supposed to arrive a month ago. Like others said, it did not.

I am not mad about the delay. Covid19 and what not, a lot of supply chains are disturbed. I get that.
But! Walmart customer service is the WOORST!
After three weeks, I gave them a call.
First, a rep told me that even though the item showed 'in process', it actually had arrived at my local walmart. So here goes the empty goose chase.

Then a week later, the second rep told me ""Oh, so sorry for your experience. Here is a voucher you can use at your next purchase. No supervisor is available but I will ""escalate"" the issue. Supposedly a supervisor would call me after 72 hours. You guessed it. They did not.

One week later, I called again. Supervisor will email you in 72 hours. You guessed it, did not.

The week after, I was fed up, and I simply wanted to cancel the order. Suddenly, the rep was able to transfer me to a supervisor. The supervisor was all understanding and what not, and said they'd cancel my order and look into ways to compensate me.

Suddenly, I start receiving automatic emails that my item was late but will be now shipped but cancelled automatically if it did not reach within 3 days.

Yeah right I don't care I said cancel the damn order. The crooks still charged me!! Now I have to go do some gymnastics at the local walmart (pick up and then return the same day) if I do not want to wait a month for them to return the item to the warehouse and issue a refund.

They asked me the fastest way would be to go to a store and return it I was hesitant going to the store due to COVID19, therefore waited for someone to pick up the product as promised by them. Days went by nothing happened. Finally I decided to go to the store and confirmed from they on 2 calls that are they sure the store will accept the return and they were very confident the store will. I went to the store and the store denied the return as the Online team has already created a label for return and their system doesn't allow them to take the product back.

What I received is 6 KN95 masks.  I contacted Musuos saying that I would not pay $107.82 for 6 masks.   They said they would give me a 50% discount.  I replied that that wasn't acceptable and I would return the masks for a full refund and requested that they send me the return information.  I haven't heard from them since.

It's a shame too because I have shopped with them for many years. In the beginning it was fabulous - the selection was great although not as good as the American walmart online. Customer service was great online and at store level.

Now however, it is scrapping the bottom of the barrel. I don't know how it got this bad. Actually I do. They started trying to copy Amazon and everything fell apart. They have a huge online inventory that is impossible to sort to find anything, they have third party vendors flogging garbage for huge sums of money, either for the product or shipping and sometimes both.

The third party vendors are NOT monitored by Walmart or made accountable to Walmart.They probably think they have hit the mother lode for the average, desperate North American consumer with our tongues hanging out to buy their garbage.

We do however, live in a democracy where we can choose who where we want to shop. I still buy the occasional item from Walmart and I have a list of the third party vendors (usually from overseas companies based in California) and I make sure that I don't use them.

Walmart - WAKE UP!! If your customers complain then listen to them. Your days are numbered as an online company if you don't. You are steadily decreasing the stock in your stores and relying on online sales. You also have mega other food stores that people can buy from.

The explosion sent into the open kitchen could have seriously injured someone-especially a child, maybe loss of sight.Spending most of a morning trying to reach a Walmart Manager I finally got through to Brea and told her of the incident.  I told her of the danger,  She asked if I wanted a refund,  Again I shared my concern about an injury.  She asked if I had a receipt.  (We have receipts for everything. My wife even has  a record of the date we where married,)  I tried to get Brea to focus on the potential of serious injury, but, I failed.  That is why I am following up with you.Please forget a refund and do what can be done to prevent injuries.

When I received the email stating the items had been shipped the delivery estimate went from decent to 5-6 weeks which was completely unacceptable.  I asked to cancel the order but the third party seller Stellar refused my request.  I advised that I would be returning both items because I needed them sooner than they could get them to me and they offered me a $2 refund instead or allowing me to return them which was a joke because they charged me $5 for delivery.  After several requests for a refund  and no help I opened a BBB complaint.  Walmart finally got involved once they had been contacted by them but all they did was forward the complaint to someone else who I assume was Stellar (who has been useless in this matter).  I finally received the 2 items and sent Walmart yet another note asking if I could return the items to a local store for a full refund and I haven't heard from them.

I have always shopped at Wal-Mart and Kmart but physically and have always had a great experience, I am in no way trying to insult anyone in any way shape or form, I am just sharing my experience with Wal-Mart.
Plus I would assume that so many people are using the shop,buy and delivery system, which is a new system that Wal-Mart experimented with and now I don't think that they expected so many people to use the shop,buy and deliver system that they didn't foresee how many workers they would need in that area of the stores department and I would give them time to adjust to how many people they would need in said department and how many people won't go and shop physically, like I said give them time and let them adjust and they'll have more people with proper cars and modes of transportation.
It's a new world and way of life, a change in the lifestyle and understanding, but many of us are still old school and get 'er done the old way in our old world.
Our time and way of life is disappearing and all this delivery to our front doors with fast food and dinner and stuff we buy from Wal-Mart is still new to us, want fast on time delivery to hen check out Japan or China or somewhere on that side of the ocean where they probably have adapted to this way of life.

I was so shocked because i had neither of them and also while shopping online, it didn't even indicate that my Walmart master card is useless at the store, this policy is no nonsensical and unprofessional.

My biggest mistake and that will not happen again. Thinking walmart is a large reputable organization, I would’ve never imagined what a TERRIBLE system they have in place for online shopping.

I made a online purchase 2 days ago and received a confirmation email that my groceries would arrive by May 19, 2020 between the hours of 2pm-3pm. Today is May 20, 2020 and I am still waiting.

I called yesterday to make a complaint and a representative assured me that my matter is being forwarded to the escalation department and I would be contacted either by phone or email. I am still waiting to hear from someone. I called again today to explain my situation and was informed the same thing, my matter would be forwarded to the escalation department.

Do yourself the biggest favour and DO NOT ORDER YOUR GROCERIES ONLINE FROM WALMART!!!!! It’s a complete waste of time, your complaints will not be heard, and you will not receive your items on the date that is promised.

We are facing a pandemic and are being encouraged to stay home as much as possible. One of the things the government is asking from the public is to do their grocery shopping online. WE ARE DOING OUR PART, DO YOUR PART WALMART!!!!!!

Was told warehouse would cancel it once i finally talked to someone. Guess what folks?! It was not. I had to wait and refuse the delivery which I did.
After refusing, I got NO updated and had to call day&ross only to find out the return tracker was different from the original tracking number. Like this isn't complicated enough?!

I find out that it was finally returned at the distribution centre only to receive an email saying that it was delivered to me, that day no less! Are you tricking serious?

https://ca.trustpilot.com/users/5e5e8d341a91693a92a760f3,1,Walmart During Covid - Essentials Only,"I am pretty disappointed with Walmart on good days but very much now since Covid. When I see all the small shops in my city closed because they have to and then I see these box stores that are allowed to open and the lineups outside the store I begin to wonder why they are allowed to sell anything in their store when the essentials should only be available including groceries, paper products, pet supplies, and other essentials. I have been into Walmart twice last year and not once this year and I intend to keep it that way. My thoughts on the box stores is they should have closed all non-essentials with no in store shopping, online only with curbside pickup for all non-essentials, non-essentials including bikes, clothing, purses, shoes, electronics, etc. This may have alleviated some of the line-ups especially if residents know all they are only going to buy and shop in store for the essentials.

This is frustrating as I think all of the small businesses that were forced to shut their doors should sue the government as most of the small businesses will be struggling while box stores will still thrive during the Covid pandemic and after. My city relies on the small businesses. I am glad I don't support Walmart in the best of times but I definitely won't be supporting them now.

There a band of young (supposed) volunteers or seasonal workers they dispatch  the mass of product into your single order. Of course you have to wait and to explain several time to different people your order until they put your list in the process. In my pickup the slot 11 to 12 noon I  came at 11:10  meeting an upset customer of 10 am slot arguing with the young (un)responsible teller man for his third delay.

They don't tell you that the product you are buying isn't even coming from them. You are purchasing your product through a third party. The payment and tracking is coming from the third party.

Instead of taking responsibility for the fact that customers aren't getting their orders. Walmart just wants to put all the ownership and blame on the third payment.

But on top of everything, just to clean up the mess quickly. Walmart Canada is more then HAPPY to provide their customers with a refund ---- even though the third party seller is the one with your money.

Walmart's customer service agents will only give you the solutions that have been written out in a book for them. They will not go that one step further to get you answers and your purchase.

I was told to contact the third payment seller. The information was no where to be found in the original email sent by Walmart Canada. The agent then told me to send an email but could not provide me with the email address. They had already send out an email on Friday regarding my order and no answer from the third party seller. The logically solution if an email doesn't work, PICK UP THE PHONE AND CALL THEM. The agent did not have the information to call and would not search for it either.

They are run by the shadow governments who want to reduce the world population. Again, they're just a cover so don't expect great customer service from them.

Honestly 1 star is far too good for this location. I went there today (April 22, 2020) and it was an absolute joke. I went through the self check out and the associate there had a face mask and a face shield. She was wiping down the keypad and screen with a used paper towel - that I saw her use on at least 5 stations without changing. On the other side the associate had a face mask but had her nose exposed and was cleaning the same way as the one on my side.
I went to customer service to find a manager and had to wait 5 minutes while she was talking to someone about bikes, and she had a face mask as well but it was covering her chin. As I waited, I watched a couple of the other tellers and one was wiping down the keypad with a dry microfibre cloth after each person and the teller beside her didn't wipe down his once, until I started speaking to the manager, in a not so quiet voice so that he could hear me and then he grabbed a dry paper towel to wipe down his keypad.
I explained this all the manager and she said ""we will try to do better"" - I told her that I doubt they would since the entire time she was speaking to the other customer and then to me, she didn't put her mask on properly.
If the associates are making such a fuss about the 2 meter distance, it does no good if things aren't being cleaned properly.

Personally, I think that if the COVID-19 could be sent by the WALMART Canada delivery system it could not affect the word and Canada at all.
The reason for this statement is based on my last 2 online orders that I had with Walmart Canada online. I am not afraid of disclosing my order numbers 2972037001550 and 2626013863. It is incredible how unprofessional are the staff working in the customer support and the worst is that all are trained to lie.
My HONEST ADVICE, STAY AWAY FROM WALMART CANADA ONLINE...you will say to me THANK YOU.
To take y9our money they go after you and even before you close the order the money is taken away from your credit cards but to get them to answer simple questions such as where is my order status?..NO ONE COULD ANSWER YOU.
it seems to me that now the professional negligence and inefficiency received a new name...""COVID-19""
But even before COVID 19, the services were the worse in the world. I gave them the last chance to redeem but I was very naive and now again in the same situation.
After seeing this situation, I am sure that if I open a new delivery system I will make more money than WALMART Canada does even at this moment under lockdown in place.
My opinion was at first..okay I won't get something from Alibaba but I trusted and order the same items from WALMART CANADA and Alibaba and the items from Alibaba are already in my hands and I still waiting for the WALMART Delivery already late by a month.
JUST WOW

Knowing that we didn't have to venture out to the grocery stores, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we were so excited when we got a delivery slot on Walmart.ca. We had been waiting 2 weeks for the delivery of our groceries only for them not to arrive. I had a delivery time of 6-7pm. We waited till almost midnight and still nothing. It has been almost 48hrs later since my delivery time; with multiple failed attempts of reaching customer service on the phone and many emails going unanswered, we still have not received our delivery. I am very disappointed in the lack of professionalism and compassion by Walmart, especially during these times when we need them most. They might as well close the business if they are unable to handle the demands of the very same customers that keep them in business. I just don't understand how so many people can have the same TERRIBLE experience. Something is really wrong here. You might even say, something CRIMINAL. How are groceries simply walking away without a trace, with no explanation? How has no one launched a criminal investigation yet? Seems like theft to me. I have requested a full refund of my order, which never arrived. We'll see how that goes.",2020-04-16

Today after waiting on the line for an hour to talk to a rude and inefficient customer representative, they told me I had to contact the seller myself through the website. Of course, the ""message the seller"" did not work and throw a nice red error saying that the request cannot go through and I should try again later.

My order never arrived on the day it was supposed to.
Next day, called customer support line FOUR times, got hung up on before I could even reach an agent. Finally, spoke with the agent who said they can refund me, but they have ZERO traction in their system to see where the grocery order actually went. Great, stuck without food for a week.

My order never appeared in my Account section. Walmart advertises that you can change your order up to the day before delivery, in case you need to add items etc, but can't even access the order in the account section to begin with. So that's futile.

Absolutely horrible experience.",2020-04-15
https://ca.trustpilot.com/users/5e96694526eeac37791abc45,1,Walmart Canada E-Commerce is Broken with COVID-19,"With the mass panic shopping driving everyone to online groceries and orders it seems like Walmart Canada has totally broken down. I used to regularly order online groceries and it was already a little frustrating but still worth the continence and prices. I thought they needed a little time to adjust but it's now been a month and it's still a problem. As everyone else I can barely get slots. Have to continuously keep checking. I have used pick-up only and did not get any cancellations but have gotten a lot of Unavailable items. I am seeing more items come back as an option to add now but at the time of delivery they don't have some of the common items. You would think they system could add the extra quantity for delivery just for the online orders.

My biggest issue has been getting in touch with Customer Service to get pricing issues resolved. They respond to some Ad Match requests and items have supposedly been ad adjusted only to find out I was charged full price at the time of delivery - if I get an e-mail before hand (sometimes I get it days after delivery but this has happened before too). If I reject items or substitution the system doesn't capture it and I haven't been getting refunds. Some of this happened before but I was usually able to have Customer Service fix it for me. The main problem now is that you can't get a hold of them. Their current response is Can't Respond to all E-mails which was the case before COVID-19. Now it seems to be Don't Respond. The customer service team is probably adjusting to the new situation as well but no responses isn't right either.

I have not been able to get them to send me return labels or complete refunds for orders before their ""breakdown"" - again not being able to contact customer service.

Pandemic's really seem to highlight incompetency especially when I compare it to Amazon.ca which had intentionally allowed it self to delay non-essentials (which they are very clear about). But I basically had no issues with them and it's almost like they were unaffected.

Maybe I will try out Loblaw's companies for online orders and see how they fare. Probably better since most other places have surprised me as to how well they are still working given the situation.",2020-04-15

HE then called me to tell me I would not be getting my order. WALMART HAS NOT REACHED OUT TO CANCEL MY ORDER OR UPDATE ME THAT MY DELIVERY IS NOT ON ITS WAY and it is now 8:30PM. I am appalled that during this time their customer service still lacks the skills of contacting customers for updates or even answering their phones. My family and I have been waiting a week and a half for this order and now we will not get it. My diabetic mother now has to go out and shop for her groceries when we should have received our order tonight. What i am most disappointed in is that fact that there are many many reviews about them cancelling orders without notice or even cancelling them and not even reaching out to the customer and no one has done anything about it. Head office and the location did not answer their phones and STILL no one has reached out to tell me I will not be receiving my order. What if my grandmother was relying on this order because I sent it to her? What if we were waiting up till 11 for our delivery to never show?

The customer service rep who refused returns said she's manager there. Items were purchased in February, I had the receipt and should have been able to return them.

This is unacceptable and not in conformity with Walmart's revised coronavirus return policy (the one in place when I purchased those items or the new one). New return policy from Walmart posted on their website clearly specifies that such items purchased before March 20 are returnable with receipt. They had return policy taped on the customer service counter that did not specify any dates.

I don't have several boxes around the home to make returns via Canada Post at this time and even if I had I doubt the returns will be processed competently. I had numerous problems in the past with incorrect items sent when ordering online, refunds not given in the right amount or at all, poor communications when making a complaint etc. In the past I even had to make a complaint at BBB to get my money back for returns that disappeared from Walmart computer at the store because of glitch in their software (Walmart help centre ignored my complaint initially).

I also want to mention the new return policy is abusive and unnecessary. There is no reason for clothing to become final sale after 20 March. You should be able to return it via Canada Post because the coronavirus is not viable after 3 days (or if you want to make sure it's completely dead you can wait 9 days since that is the published maximum life of this virus on objects.). All you need for the virus to die is not open the package for 3 days (max 9). Also there is also absolutely no logical reason not to accept returns for 3/more same items. I personally don't have more than 3 of anything and I did not purchase clothing/shoes after 20 March but I am outraged by the new return policy. There should be a class action lawsuit for such abuses under the pretext of coronavirus.",2020-04-06

The least Wal Mart can do is employ more reps to work from home to answer calls but obviously Walmart does not want to errode their bottom line to help the Canadian public!!!!",2020-04-06

Each time Walmart provided me with 75% of the groceries that I ordered. I think that’s very reasonable and understandable, given the underlying public health circumstances. Each time I waited in my car about ten minutes between calling the pickup number and the Walmart staff loading my groceries in the trunk of my car. They are incredibly polite and diligent, and I have the utmost respect for their services. I look forward to using their service in the future. Thank you!",2020-04-06

Trying to find something specific, and no matter how specific you are, it will not bring up what you were looking for. As well as it won’t identify any of the items available in store, only as online. Which I would have seen these items in that specific store the very same day.  I have put in specifically Sony smart TV, and the first 17 items may be TVs but not a Sony brand. And then the remaining next 20 items are not even TVs. I don’t know why online services in Canada are so terrible it’s not just Walmart but this is an example.

place order, not sent email ""invoice/reciept"" as it should have been right off the bat (like every other company I have ever placed orders with, in an online marketplace...especially given this is Walmart.ca website for Walmart.ca)

this is a MASSIVE PROBLEM, given, amount shows on credit card already (likely pending, for them to ""hopefully"" fill properly for this coming Tuesday ""pick up"" between 6-7pm @ Brockville Parkdale location

Cannot access my account at all, tried switching to other 2 emails I have, ""successful"" but cannot log into any account, though I was able to place order.

How can I reset password (as an idea) if account is NOT recognized by their system, let alone, using the ""success"" emails (verified on their end, as sent email) cannot reset / log in, to these accounts at all.

What a terrible joke, am running low on food, family I am living with ""more or less"" refuse to go shopping (if I need it) but they of course will go out, seemingly every day if they need to, for this exact reason.

@#$ sucks lemon to have to deal with this as well, I am very low income person, with health problem, last thing I need is a grocery order to not go through properly, claim it went through (but not given a receipt..have to log into account to see / change the order / ask for refund...how can one do this, if you cannot @#$ log into it?

T_T

edit-- try calling today to see if can get assistance, over 2fk hours on hold, sounds like someone picking up line, disconnect from call

finally someone after 4;30 hours on hold, static over line, he cannot hear what I am saying properly, though does say ""sir can you hear me.. make this now 4 disconnects moment sounds like someone about to pickup line

now over 6hr hold time total, 6 disconnects, only 1 answered (though repeated toggle sound on/off instead of transfer to another ""associate""..till he hung up on me as well..or their system did.

FFS .. so much for will address ""contact us"" emails in 48-72 hours as well (yes is weekend, I get it)

but seriously, if order placed, amount ""pending"" on Credit Card, should be emailed forthwith so problems like this can be avoided...what a load of crap I do not see this being addressed in 72 hours (come just after 5pm today) seeing as even the facebook page - send a private message - no response either .. far from first person to complain about this

----

line ups will be bad enough, given that whole ""keep distance, few in store at a time policy, well after the fact"" to potentially lose $170 if/when ordered is ""handled"" that I may not be able to access, certainly ""locked up"" till this happens, really @$# me off.",2020-04-04

Walmart has not bothered to fill up the shelves and the shelves continue to remain empty. The just in time principles have led to empty shelves for months,as the supply chain is completely messed up.

Maybe Walmart may try to increase the price of these essentials, when the demand is so high, when the whole world is sitting together to see how they can help humanity.

Keeping in mind this monstrous shopping of essentials, Walmart must not allow more than one pack of toilet roll per person.

Listen you could have called a manager, charged the amount to my Walmart MasterCard then returned the purchase on the original visa card I used but Noooooooo of course they wouldn’t simply because it’s too much work for them to even think about.

Imbeciles... next time I go in there I’m going to make them give me the 3$ back for not imputing the damn coupons that were right on the god damn Dukes sausages I bought! fools... do your job properly if you see a coupon on the package then apply the discount you sad fools.

I talked to the Associate he understand my complain, he forwarded me to grocery manager she understand me and she asked the other customer Associate to refund me but they couldn’t do it because it was an online order. She forwarded me to the other customer service manager (not so sure) I explained to her again she didn’t understand me well. The first Associate i talked to explained to her in their own language and she understand. She told me to listen while I was trying to explain to her. Customer service should listen first the customers complaints. I was calm, my voice is firm and clear but she told me to calm down. Tried to explained to her showing my bank statement and emails from Walmart and told her I need a full refund. She called another CSR then she said I get a refund in the next few days.

Customer service manager is rude.

https://ca.trustpilot.com/users/5e5ed5fa1a9169521da7920f,1,Horribly damaged skillet :(,"This is a review for Walmart.ca. My item was a T-fal 5 quart skillet. The box arrived with a huge dent in it (like someone had kicked it the length of a football field) but I figured it would be okay as a skillet is a pretty robust item. Upon opening the box I became more concerned as the skillet was swimming around in the large box with a small amount of brown paper on ONE SIDE to protect it. First I noticed the lid had two small dents in the metal ring but I shrugged and resolved in my head to use it if the lid still fit. I detached the lid and tried to place it on the skillet... it overhung by almost an inch on one side. To my horror I saw that the side with the handle was almost completely flat it was so dented/damaged. I am not only FURIOUS with the inconvenience of having to return this item, but that a perfectly nice item will now likely end up in a landfill without a day's use. I'm in awe of the complete and utter carelessness of the person who packaged the item for shipping - as well as the person or people who handled it (what is this, United Airlines baggage check!?).",2020-03-03

I go to one of the in store scanners to check the price, just in case and the scanners shows $29.95.  I find a clerk and asked her to check the price and her scanner shows $29.95.  So we go back to the “discount Rack” and find several other pairs at the same price $29.95.  So I ask her what the deal was and she tells me that that had not finished making the price adjustments to those pants.  So I discovered that what they were doing was removing the tear off tags for $24.95 and placing the pants on a “discount rack” for $29.95.

Last spring I ordered a large screen TV and wall mount for my workplace. The TV arrived (very fast), but the mount did not. I was charged for both items as soon as they were deemed to have been shipped. Unfortunately it took me months of fighting with Walmart Customer (non) Service to get a refund for the wall mount while they investigated my 'claim' of non-delivery.

On the up side, some orders were placed and arrived without too much of a delay.

https://ca.trustpilot.com/users/5e1caedc013d417d39218624,1,Walmart and the third Party Tasharina Corp are Pathetic and big time cheaters,"Tasharina Corp is the most pathetic online shopping third party service, I have ever faced in my life.

I wish I had read their reviews before ordering through Walmart.
Firstly, they are highly unprofessional. They are so big cheaters that they want to eat customer's money out and trouble them.
They do not have the sense of delivering the order on time but they are in complete senses to force the order on you once you receive it post 20 days of the delivery date.

Pathetic company, huge set of cheaters and the most shameless organization I have ever seen.

I am providing proof of their emails where they are forcing me to keep the item and return only 30% of the amount when I asked for a refund

Walmart has been an extreme troublemaker this time. I am extremely unhappy about the order that I placed online from Walmart Canada. Firstly, the order got divided into two types.
Type One -- Groceries – This was delivered through door dash delivery on the expected day but wrong time and hence, I had to wait most of the time at home to just receive the order.
Type Two
- Product One – From Walmart – Magic Bullet Blender – Estimated delivery Date 18th Dec 2019, which kept on changing to different dates like 27th Dec, 2019. Canceled this order on 26th Dec, 2019 but still received the order on 31st December, 2019. I had to take trouble of making multiple calls then finally go by myself to return the order to Canada Post. What is the point of shopping online if the executives ask you to visit Walmart to return the order?
Pathetic People

- Product Two – from Tasharina Corp – This one is a huge blunder and I really do not have any strength to explain the scenario. I will be attaching the email conversation on google reviews as I do not have an option in TrustPilot

Basically, Tasharina is a cheater company and Walmart cheated on me too. If I do an online purchase from Walmart Canada then how can Walmart run away from their responsibility and ask me to deal with the third party on my own? Walmart and Tasharina are partners in a way and hence, the products are available to shop online on Walmart’s website. So According to Walmart, you can buy their partnered product online but cannot return through them.

I am simple frustrated and would never ever shop from Walmart.",2020-01-13

Provided shipping address & name, email, order number and since it was my mother in laws billing address they refused to release any info so I replied with her info and they said it’s processing. Fast forward 3 weeks, received a email saying my items were back ordered then a few hours later another email saying that my items were out of stock, I emailed and said just cancel, I’ll buy elsewhere and the dumb customer service person again wouldn’t release any info even though I put her name along with all the other info and want me to call them. So dumb, I’ll never order online from walmart again.",2020-01-11
https://ca.trustpilot.com/users/5e1949ce4c245309e2fe14a8,1,Poor experience with online order.,"Poor experience with online order.

Placed an order on Thursday and paid the extra fee to have it delivered on Friday between 7-9 pm. Nobody showed up. Upon calling the call center to check the status, was basically told that it is too bad that the order didnt make it. No option to have it delivered at the next available time or a second attempt.

Terrible experience. Delivery folks are unreliable. Call-center just tries to deflect and end the call rather than resolve the situation.

Stick to Amazon or Loblaw delivery.

Ordered an item in the middle of December 2019 and the confirmation indicated that it would be delivered around the 19th. Fine.
We closed our office for the holidays and when we came back, still no package. We had received an email prior to closing our office indicating that the package was ""on its way"" and would be delivered by Loomis (gave tracking number). I contacted Loomis, but they simply indicated that they had never received the item yet from Walmart.
Contacted Walmart and they said they would investigate. Two days later we get a message indicating that our ""refund request has been completed""! We didn't request a refund. Contacting them again they indicate that apparently the item was ""damaged"" in transit so it had to be returned. Fair enough...except the item was NEVER SHIPPED as confirmed by Loomis! They then said we would have to order the item again to receive it.

To add to confusion, I'd show up to collect a certain item and it would be a different one than I received email notice for; this makes it hard to track. Also, I found their web site cumbersome and all three items were listed under the same tracking number - very odd. I was told I'd be refunded for an item that failed to show up, but weeks later got a call that it was in. In conclusion, too confusing and too much work. Too many calls and visits to store.

So I wandered around some more then tired of searching I went to customer service, they had no clue if they even sold it !!  I asked them if they could look on the computer and they said no, I need a UPC code ... well how would I have that if you keep sending me on a goose chase, and you can’t even tell me if you have it !  The MOD’s are ridiculous, stand there not trying to assist in any way with customer service - their staff and MOD’s need more training in areas and items they carry ... instead of sending their customers on searches that turn up nothing!

https://ca.trustpilot.com/users/5df19c511ef7dc7171ddcc80,1,Bad Online Experience,"I ordered a set of LED string lights online from what I thought was Walmart but it turned out to be a 3rd part Marketplace Supplier (MS). Thereafter, I was directed to correspond directly with the MS (a Chinese company) re: any issues related to the order. During the ordering process there was no way to specify the colour of the LEDs I wanted so I sent an email to the MS indicating that I wanted white LEDs and not coloured. I was assured I would get same and about 3 weeks later the lights arrived (at Walmart). When I got home and opened the package I realized I had gotten coloured lights. I informed the MS and was told they would send white lights but that they had to be sent through Walmart as before. After a month or so no lights so I again contacted the MS and was told that their tracking software indicated they had been delivered to a location in a nearby town which I assumed to be Walmart's distribution centre. I then emailed Walmart's 'heretohelp' customer service (definitely a misnomer) and was informed that I had to deal strictly with the MS. I was also informed not to reply to the brush off email they had sent. The MS is now saying the shipment must have been lost, that they don't have any white LEDs in stock (did they ever?) and asked me if I wanted a refund. We'll see how that turns out. Bottom line is that although Walmart was happy to process my payment, take their cut and act as the delivery agent for the original (wrong) order sent by the MS they were absolutely no help when things went of the rails. I do not recommend using Walmart Marketplace - its unreliable and there's no backup support from Walmart.",2019-12-12

I had them shipped to the local store.  When my items came in, there were two boxes.  One was the stand I ordered and the other was one of the dumbells.  When I asked where my other dumbell was, the store said I was shipped two boxes and I got two boxes.  They said to call customer service.  I called customer service and they told me I ordered two items and got two items.  This was pretty frustrating.  These are 90lb dumbells and only one comes in a box. My two items were supposed to come in 3 boxes but their customer service does not have the visibility to see this.  They kept repeating that I ordered two items and got two items.  Finally they agreed to excalate my problem and said I would hear back within 24-48hrs.  I called back after 48hrs and spoke to someone else who said sorry for your troubles, I will escalate this for you. 5 days or 120hrs later I have still heard nothing.  They said if I wasn't happy with the items I can return them.  I asked how I could return what I don't yet have.  I said I'm happy with what I have received, I just want my remaining dumbell.  I just want to know if it's still coming, when it might come, and to be reassured that I'm not get scammed out of about 400 bucks.  The second person couldn't escalate any further than the first one.  There seems to be nothing I can do. I am completely at their mercy.

Unforunately the store had sold out but the manager mentioned that it was still available online.  I proceeded to order this item online.  I did not receive an email confirmation until the following day.  I thought this was odd but since it was Black Friday I figured it was just a busy time and it took a day to get the confirmation.

She answered, ""Well you should know your size""... (HUGE eyeroll here).  Being a woman, you'd think she was smart enough to know that everyone's boobs are different, even if they wear the same size!  But I understand it's not HER policy, it's stupid Walmart's new policy.  I wonder if they allow women to try bras on in the dressing room now?

I opted and made the huge mistake to do a large grocery purchase through Walmart mount pearl Newfoundland and I was double charged $140.00. When I used my Visa debit the purchase went through on my card YET the cashier ignorantly suggested that my card was expired and I would have to pay another way even though this moneyof $140.00  HAD already come out of my account because the date on my card said expired I was told I had to pay another way. I was forced to goto the atm pay disgusting atm fees to get cash out and pay for my order AGAIN IN CASH! The cashier then did a post date return on my card for the money that had been ALREADY deducted!!! I then had to wait well......this is the 9th day and STILL NO MONEY RETURNED to my account!!!! This is in no way a proper procedure or the right way to have this resolved and should NEVER have happened to begin with when it ALREADY was deducted out of my account and I am left 140$ short for now going on 10 days while Walmart does whatever with MY money and inconvenience and missed payment due to that money not being where it's supposed to be in MY ACCOUNT!!!!!!! This is a disgusting experience and I will NEVER set foot in another Walmart EVER because of this!!!where is my compensation for the ignorance this store and employee has caused as well as the unbelievable time it's taking to give MY MONEY BACK!!!!! Like seriously this is firggin ridiculous!!!!! I will not have 1 nice thing to say to anyone in the future about the  Walmart experience and feel stolen from!!!!! There is no excuse NONE for the delay in this corporate taking this amount of time to have MY MONEY returned to me!!!!!!!!! I will NEVERshope at Walmart again. Ever!,2019-10-22

It truly amazes me how a company like this stays in business. I am finished with this company. It costs me money and time to constantly drive there only to be told “ out of stock”.Who’s doing the ordering for this company? They don’t seem to have clue that on popular specials that everyone will want they need to order a lot more than they do. Otherwise all they do is upset customers to the point who like myself will very much limit my buying anything from them. Besides all of that I have noticed lately  that a lot of items at Walmart are getting to be quite expensive and are cheaper elsewhere .

We ordered it on the Sept 15th and then received an update that it was shipped and would be in the store for Sept 17th.  Well we then waited for an email that would never come to say it arrived.  We then went to the store and they said oh yes it has been received but we cant find the shoes.  So they took our number (and never called us) and then we had to call back.  Then customer service said oh your shoes are not due to arrive until tomorrow the 24th, sure enough they updated the record and then denied ever having shipped to the store in the first place.  So basically it was shipped to store, they lost it, if we never went in or talked to them we would still be waiting (which we still are), then they lie about what happened.  Given that they lost them in the first place, they then should have done next day ship to the house, instead still waiting and have to go back yet again.  The agents have poor customer service. The other issue when calling them is you get routed to the US or who knows where and they cannot find customer order number until you tell them you are from Canada.  Seriously I called a Canadian number so how hard would that be to figure out.  We actually asked to speak to someone in Canada which they refused to do, so we hung up called back and then ask to speak to someone in Canada.  Note: Do to privacy it is every Canadian's right to ask to speak to someone in your own Country.We will never order from Walmart online again and have not had this kind of problem with Amazon, Petsmart etc.   Unless they improve I dont think they will be playing in the online space very long.",2019-09-23

https://ca.trustpilot.com/users/5d765d0868e49b6150797caa,2,Walmart Canada Online Shopping Leaves LOTS to be desired,"Like many other writers to this site, I have been highly disappointed by my experience shopping online with Walmart Canada.

I attempted to purchase 'Commercial Aluminum Chairs' from Walmart Canada in late August, 2019. There were two reasons I chose them - first, their price was exceptionally competitive compared to Wayfair.ca, but most important, they claimed a very short delivery time (under 9 days) for the products. Timing of arrival was quite significant to me.

I went online to place the order. The online website is 'funky' at best - I was unable to select the ship-to-home option, and was forced to use the ship-to-store option. My order got placed, and within a day, I had an update on delivery, and a tracking number. (Delivery date was confirmed as Sept. 2).

A few days later, I went to check my shipping status - and could not use the tracking number - there was no link on my order status page. I did have the carrier name and the tracking number, so I attempted to track at Purolator International Courier, and could not. I received an 'Exception' response.

On Sept 2, I went into the store to check, and the product had not been delivered. On Sept. 3, I went online and used the 'help centre' e-mail. I received a reply, but the reply did not address my concern, which related to tracing my shipment and giving me an accurate delivery date.

I contacted Walmart.ca by phone. There I had a very helpful person who confirmed for me that 'the tracking number was wrong', and that it would take 2-3 days to trace this and 'someone would get back to me'. No one did.

On Sept. 5 I received an email notification from the store that my shipment had arrived. I went to the store and took the box of chairs, which was sealed. I got home, opened the box, and found that the interior packing had been insufficient to protect the chairs, and one of the cross-members had the finish chipped off it, most of the legs were scratched, and one of the seat slats was bent.

I contacted Walmart.ca to discuss. What I wanted was for them to send me a replacement set of chairs, and upon receipt and inspection, I would return the others. This is the method that Amazon uses when product is defective - they send you a replacement, and charge you ONLY if you don't return the original order within a period of time.

What I was offered was the chance to re-order the chairs, at a 10% discount for my trouble, and then return the other set to the Walmart store. Upon receipt, I would be credited for the initial purpose. What this meant to me was TWO charges on my credit card for ONE product, and an unknown replacement date for the chairs (for which shipping was originally problematic).

I was not satisfied with the response, so I took the time to find a place to send in a complaint on the Walmart Canada corporate website. I asked that my concerns be directed to the Sr. EVP, Marketing, and the Sr. EVP, e-Commerce. To my knowledge, it was not routed there, and I received another 'stock response', this time indicating that I would be given an additional $15.00 credit on my Walmart.ca account.

I had the distinct feeling when I was trying to speak with people on the phone, that I was not even dealing with Walmart. While I had had exceptional satisfaction buying through the store; and yes, even with their third-party 'product extended warranty company', Asurion, I really cannot say that my experience with the online portion of Walmart is anywhere near 'up to snuff'.

All this, coupled with a website that 'periodically' could not connect to My Account, My Orders, had a bad Tracking Number for my Order, and did not maintain accurate delivery dates; and did not (at the time) have functionality to support 'Ship-to-Home' for this product, led me to believe that Walmart Canada has rushed their effort to have an online presence, and is using some 'other' third party to provide the Walmart.ca e-Commerce Catalog and Platform, as well as fulfillment.

I have identified other major retailers who do the same thing, and I have taken my time and energy to avoid them, as they really have no interest (the third parties) in customer service.

As you can read, I am giving Walmart Canada a GIANT benefit of the doubt. However, right now I am sitting with 4 'commercial' aluminum chairs which work, but are blemished and should not have been, and the manner in which Walmart wants to make good is nowhere near the level of customer support and satisfaction that I have come to expect, with professional online resellers such as Amazon.ca.

So, beware to all of you who intend to try Walmart.ca for convenience. It leaves a LOT to be desired in fulfillment, quality and customer service. I have asked that this note be copied to the Walmart people', with the hope it will eventually make it to their EVPs of Marketing and e-Commerce.",2019-09-09

I quite enjoy shopping at Walmart so my review is mainly about their online ordering.  Firstly, the website doesn't work half the time.  Once you have spent half an hour entering your order it hangs and you have to change browsers because the cart doesn't work on Chrome.I have ordered twice from walmart.ca in as many years.  The first time I ordered a very simple order of yard bags - 4 bundles of three for a total of 12 bags.   3 weeks later I received a total of 4 bags, unbundled.  I had to call in and they sent me the difference finally.Most recently I ordered 2 clearance products, both the same.  They were stocked in Northwest Calgary  and I had them hold for pickup at the Deerfoot location in NE Calgary as they offer this service.  I placed my order on the 16th of August, 2019 and my card was charged. About a week later I got an email stating that my order was in transit and should arrive at the Deerfoot location on the 23rd.  On the 28th I went to Deerfoot to inquire.  There was no one at the service desk but there was a big sign to call a certain phone number for pickup inquiries.   Steamed, I called the number and after about 5 minutes I was told that my order was not in and they couldn't tell me when it would be.I then went to their website and had to poke around for 10 minutes to find a contact number for online shopping.  I called the number but there was no option to speak to anyone.  Just press 1 for status of the order, so I pressed 1.  I was told that my order was expected on the 23rd of August, and then asked to return to main menu.  Since it was already the 28th, I then tried the online chat.  After a couple of minutes a lady came on and I explained my concern.   Mostly she responded with scripted responses. It was very obvious that they give these responses to everyone.  She assured me by script that they will look into the matter.  She gave me a case number.When I pressed her to find out will they notify me I was told they have no access to email. She explained I can expect  up to 14 business days after order is placed, just to go from one store in Calgary to another just a few miles away. I pressed her for more information and the response was ""is there anything else I can help you with""?  I asked her for a copy of the communication in the chat box and was told they don't provide that ) so I will have no record of the chat).  So their help line was of no value whatsoever.  My next stop is to register a fraudulent charge on my credit card.   I will give them another week and if my order is still not in that will be my last resort.  It is ridiculous.  While Amazon offers same day delivery, Walmart just can't get a simple transaction done in 3 weeks.  Not to mention they charge at least $5 order entry fee - Ridiculous!

https://ca.trustpilot.com/users/5d605d49dca1674d8daaa27b,1,Walmart.ca scam,If I could give 0 stars I would. I purchased a product from Walmart.ca online and apparently it was through a 3rd party company. When I tried to take the product back to Walmart within my allotted 90 days they told me I was unable to return it due to the company (ami ventures inc) 7 days return policy. The product was missing parts upon arrival! When I called Walmart.ca they told me the same ridiculous story. They then said they would contact the company to return the product because of the missing parts. They informed me if I didn’t receive an email within 2 business days to call them back. I bought this product from Walmart not an external company. Why am I now fighting with an external company to return the product? This is a scam! Walmart is not informing there customs upon purchase of the “marketplace” products and their return polices. They are expecting customer to know this. Now I have to call Walmart again to escalate it. Walmart needs to refund my money as this is where I brought the product and the product is defective with missing parts.  90% of products sold at Walmart at not Walmart banded. Should consumers know thousands of return policies? I will never shop at Walmart.ca again. It’s a SCAM!,2019-08-23

Why bother with an online clothing store/section if the majority of the sizes are S-M-L. Which is the same every store carries. But not all stores carry XS or XXL sizes. They even have their line of, George Plus sizes advertised on the site, but the online store doesn't actually carry the plus sizes. Or when it does its a very narrow selection. I don't need Plus size ankle length long johns in the SUMMERtime, but sometimes that is all that is listed for the PLUS sizes.

Not all stores actually carry what the website claims they have plenty in stock. After visiting the stores directly you find out from store employee's they either have never carried that item or are out of stock even though the website clearly states, ""In Stock"".

But lately my pantry shelf orders have been routed to their, ""Grocery"" site where even if we meet the $50 minimum, because we have to book a time slot to pick up our pantry orders? We end up paying an extra $25 ??? The Grocery site was meant for perishable and fresh goods. But shelf stable pantry items should not be pushed into that category and thus forcing us to pay extra for something by their own claims should be, ""free shipping"", if we meet their $50 minimum requirement.

Other times when added pantry items to my cart, on check out the cart flags certain item as not included in the minimum $50 calculations and I need X amount more to meet that amount???

The order was confirmed by email and I was looking forward to receiving the items to use in my home for my grandson. Not 10 minutes later an additional email arrived stating that the crib sheet could be picked up but the crib and mattress were not available at this time.

Today, August 7, 2019 we went to the store and only the sheet was available. No one in management could locate the crib or mattress and now we are left with no furniture for our grandson to sleep in.

We are disappointed, disgusted and disgruntled. Walmart promised us the followed but never fulfilled their promise:
1. A crib, crib mattress and crib sheet.
2. An email no later than August 2, 2019 if the order could not be processed.
3. A crib and mattress to pick up on August 7, 2019.

We wasted time, gas and energy on something that they likely will never have in their inventory. We did not receive any email or phone call to let us know that there was no merchandise to be picked up and that in itself is the worst PR in the business.

got in touch with customer service - useless, tried to shame them on their Facebook page they said ""we will look into it"" etc.
was all useless, UPS won't deliver the item unless I pay the import tax so I will do that for now as it is a long awaited gift for my son.
It's a longboard skateboard so we will use it for 89/90 days and rage return it :)
I asked for an elegant solution like Walmart to pay for the tax since I am doubled taxed (legally HST and import tax overlap it's not legal to pay it twice) and fix their process with UPS on their own - silence from them. A 48h solution is not acceptable as I stated I need to pay for UPS to deliver.
Their system is so broken personally will never buy anything from them again definitely not online. To me is shocking that such a big company has such a broken system.

EDIT: Well finally Walmart reached to me and did the right thing. I went ahead and paid the import taxes so I can receive the item; Walmart offered to reimburse my credit card with that amount and also as a gesture of good will they will mail me a gift card.

Also, their delivery service policies are completely one-side (to Walmart's self-prioritization), with utter lack of regard for the customer's needs and fairness. They do not allow for any modifications to the delivery, they do not allow the customer to have access to their contracted shippers, they do not give you notification about missing items, nor do they make any effort to compensate for their errors, as most other major grocery delivery services would.

Forgetting one or two items adds up to costing YOU money, don't forget that.

0/10 never EVER ordering again.

The store is in disarray with merchandise scattered and unkept on the shelves or laying on the floor.
I have seen staff members texting or talking on their personal iPhones or talking with each other about their after work plans while I wait to ask a question.

There is one manager (Jackie) who is abrupt and uses foul language in front of customers. I have been witness to several of her outbursts the last one was at the checkout till where she yelled ""Jesus Christ""! The store was crowded at the time.

I shop at Walmart at least twice weekly. I have been in many Walmart stores in canada and the USA. The Walmart in Trail BC is in need of a revamping.",2019-06-28

I had stood in some lineups at some stores for 20 minutes watching the Cashier go through all the crap of signing up for the card. This was at the Uxbridge, Ontario, store.

They stopped it - it seemed - for quite some time. Over a year. Maybe more. Occasionally a cashier would ask if I'm interested in the Walmart card but when I said no, that was the end of it. They stopped being ""pushy"".

In the past couple of weeks, they've started it up again with a vengeance.

My wife just got back from an ordeal at the checkout. The cashier was non-stop pushing that damned credit card to the lady in front of her. When my wife got to the cash, she told the cashier not to bother with the pitch for the card because she's not interested.

The cashier turns around and tells her ""it's my job to tell you about the card and if I want to tell you about it, I'm going to do so.

Wife replied ""Do it, and I'll leave"". The cashier told her ""go ahead and leave then, you're not going to stop me from doing my job"". (WHAT kind of training are these cashiers getting when they'd say something like this to a customer?) She started telling my wife about the card, my wife tossed everything on the conveyor back into the cart, and went to another checkout. (Who had the sense to NOT start telling her about their card.

Next time they pull this crap on my wife or myself, I won't be going to another checkout. The entire order will be left on the conveyor and I'll be going to another store. PERMANENTLY.

Guess what, WALMART? The checkout is NOT a place where you get to waste your customers valuable time, and hold them hostage while they get browbeaten and coerced into signing up for your credit card by aggressive, overbearing cashiers who have apparently been told it's OK to upset off customers to the point that they leave your store.",2019-06-23

They will charge your card, then “cancel” the order 7 hours after purchase, then refuse to refund your money. I’m out $500, they swore it would be returned within 3-5 days, it’s been 6 days and still no refund. The supervisor kept claiming it was a bank problem and that the money is just “on an authorization hold”. My bank kept claiming it was NOT a bank problem, that it is NOT on hold, and that Walmart has in fact withdrawn the money. The supervisor at Walmart kept arguing that this is false. So I put my bank and Walmart supervisor both on speaker phone and asked the supervisor to please explain what he is talking about because my bank was FLABBERGASTED at what he was saying. He automatically refused, stating “If you continue to bully me with these third party calls, I will have no choice but to end this phone call”. How else am I supposed to get answers?? I request a manager and SURPRISE! No manager on duty, but they'll have one call me as soon as possible. No call ever came. 6 days later and Walmart still hasn’t refunded the money, I call back and finally got a manager, now management is saying to wait until Monday maybe. Each department adamantly refuses to allow you to speak with their supervisors, making it very difficult to deal with any problem. This has been an absolute nightmare, I’m out $500 and still don’t have the item I purchased last Saturday. Outrageous. Walmart, this is basically theft. You take money from me. You won't send me the item. You won't refund my money. Your employees have ZERO customer service skills as all they do is defend why I'm not allowed to have my money refunded yet, and do nothing to help the customer. The manager claims he is the highest person a customer can speak to so I have nobody to report is insufficient customer service to, and no one to ask to help me. PLEASE just give me my money back so I can order from a reputable company that actually sends your items. You need to train your employees better, you need to get rid of the employees that refuse to provide even semi-adequate customer service, and for the love of god, do not hold customer's money hostage for zero reason!",2019-06-21

I called to say I want my money back and want to cancel my order as I do not want it. The man asked for my first and last name and said ok he will cancel it. I than stated do you not nee to know my order number and he said no. So I asked to speak to the manager and he said no the manager will call me in 5 minutes. I waited 10 minutes and no manager called. I called the number back and the person who answered said that they were the manager. I told them everything, they told me they can not find my order and it has not arrived. I said i got an email saying my item is ready for pick up. He asked me to verify that.

Ordered a product, received a shipment email but the tracking number didn't work.  after a few days I called customer service at Walmart and was told to wait 2-4 days.  It seems customer service are in the Philippines?  Still didn't work after waiting.  Called them back, they still didn't know what was going on so I cancelled the order and purchased the same product through Amazon - which was delivered without any issues with 48 hours!  The day after I cancelled the Walmart order I got another shipment confirmation saying the product had been shipped - this time the tracking number worked and the estimated delivery was a week later?  I called them back they said they couldn't stop the shipment and I noticed my credit card had been charged?  I told them I had cancelled the order and they said it was too late/too bad I had to receive the order now and refuse it.  On the designated day of delivery the order never arrived - it's now 10 days later and the order still hasn't arrived and still no refund.  I called back yet again to see what was going on.  They didn't know and asked if ""I"" had called the shipment company?  Me?  That's not my job?  That's your responsibility. They tell me to call back in week!  I call back in a week to see if they had received the return order. No they told me to call back in a week - I got the same runaround, they didn't know where it was maybe still in transit.  I asked for my refund, they said I needed to return the order - which I couldn't as I never received it.  Once again I was told they would look into it and escalate it - this is now my 10th or 12th phone call to customer service in three weeks with no resolve.  So, I broke down and called the shipment company to ask if they could help ""me"" track the order so I could have it returned to Walmart?  I am doing their job for them as I just want this resolved - how sad is that.  The shipping company didn't know where it was but did say they would look into it and call me back.  Who knows if they will.  So, I decided to call my credit card co. and asked for their help.  I explained the situation, they were amazing they have disputed the purchase and I will have a refund in my account within 2 business days, if Walmart disputes the refund things will continue to go on for who knows how long!  Thank goodness for good customer service through my bank.  It's been an absolute nightmare dealing with this issue with Walmart - nobody cares on the other end of the phone.  It's almost made me sick.  My advice to those going through the same issue and I see there are lots of you, call your credit card company and ask for their help!  Most credit card companies will.

I even had two supervisor requests put in, all of which were also never give response. The Reps are sickeningly sweet, apologize too many times, claim they understand, but do squat. All of them gave me a different story every time I called. It's now two weeks later. I still don't have my items, they are still lying to me, blaming their 3rd party vendors, and also claiming that email and ""waiting 48hrs"" is the only way to get a hold of these people. I have lost track of the escalations that have been done, I am actually counting on never getting my items. I also have come to the conclusion that two people can play this game. I'll take further action.
I will never shop with them again, I don't trust them at all. And I agree...i think they get paid to lie and put you off. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS SICK ONLINE SHOP!!!",2019-05-15

Stonegate Supercentre
3035 Clarence Ave. South
Saskatoon, Sask, S7T 0B6

On April 23, 2019 I met Operator #000507 at Checkout Till #17. This clerk discriminates against the physically disabled. This clerk spoke pleasantly to walking people (to those before and after me in line). But when it was my turn at the checkout, when I rode up on my scooter, the clerk's manner was suddenly stern and snappish. The clerk began to ""act tough"" toward me.

The clerk's motive, on the surface, was the presence of Walmart bags on my scooter from previous shopping that day. My errands were finished early, and transport would not arrive for an hour, so I re-entered Walmart to tackle another item on my To-Do List. My bags were tied and my receipt was nestled securely in my purse. I was stunned at the clerk's behavior, and offered to show her my Walmart receipt.

It was I who volunteered to show my receipt, so there was no excuse for the clerk's next move: She left her position at the Till and strutted over to stand within 4 inches of my scooter. This invaded personal boundaries. The look on her face was over-eager as she waited for me to find my receipt. When I handed it to her, she read it -- and her face fell. Why? All my shopping and my bags were accounted for. Everything was kosher -- the clerk should have been happy. Instead she was disappointed. The clerk got robbed all right -- robbed of her drama.

Walmart boasts an ""Accessibility Plan for Disabled Customers."" But the store must make more effort to train clerks to have insight into their own reactions.",2019-05-03
https://ca.trustpilot.com/users/5cc7d6303e992b6c10356068,1,Very disappointing service for flood victims,"Hello,
Today I am writing to you out of confusion and frustration. I have been a loyal Walmart customer for years, always happy and satisfied with the great products and the exceptional service until today unfortunately...

I am a flood victim that has been evacuated from her home and The Red Cross offered us a certificate for provision at the Walmart we chose in order to eat until we can go back home. I was happy to choose Walmart on Robert Bourassa Street in Laval Québec to do my groceries at and the certificate is for the amount of 260$; and when my groceries amounted to 264$, I was happy to pay the difference.

The manager Hafiz told me it could not be done and went along with her with taking items out so it can be less then 260$ but then, Ms Hafiz advised that the difference could not given and will be kept by Walmart which is contrary to the recommendation of the Red Cross that advised to use all the money allocated since it will all be given to Walmart and Walmart should not short change the customer/flood victims.

I already had a big day at work and trying to struggle to come back home and see where we are going to sleep with the kids and I didn’t have the energy to argue with Ms Hafiz who doesn’t seem to care and has no customer service skills.

When Ms Hafiz managed to complicate the situation by stepping out to chit chat with her friends while making us wait for her colleague Joanie that never showed, we got tired and went to see Ms Hafiz informing her that we are leaving. Contrary to her resolving the problem and with her condescending and prejudice attitude, showed us the door with no remorse as if she was doing us a favor when in reality the Red Cross was

All this to say that I have never judged the brand from one person representing it but today I am a very dissatisfied customer and passing a hard time and your manager fully knew we are flood victims and instead of being understanding, empathetic, human and diplomatic, she was very rude and hurtful.

https://ca.trustpilot.com/users/5b7f33944de5666d340989c7,1,My Walmart.ca order is two weeks late,"My Walmart.ca order is two weeks late. I have wasted hours every day for two weeks with both the courier they chose and with Walmart.ca telephone reps. I kept getting the run-around, it seemed like nobody at either Walmart or the courier could tell me where my order was, why it hadn't yet been delivered, or even if it would be delivered.

So after two weeks of this nonsense I asked for my money back. Walmart said they couldn't give me a refund unless it was authorized by a manager. So I asked to speak to a manager and was told, of course, that nobody was available. In fact, I was told that there was no one there that they could transfer me to who is able to authorize a refund. WHAT?!!

Long story longer, I was finally able to speak to someone at the courier company who was able to actually track my package and low and behold it turns out that my order never left the Walmart warehouse! Walmart never shipped it to the courier.

So I call Walmart AGAIN and told them they hadn't shipped my order to the courier. They checked and confirmed that was indeed the case, and apologized. So at this point I asked them to cancel my order because if it hasn't been shipped from Walmart yet, I should be able to cancel it, right? Oh no no no... nothing is ever easy or common sense when it comes to Walmart. I was told that they can't cancel my order because it was less than a $100 order. Apparently only orders of $100 and up can be cancelled.... WHAT??!!! What the hell difference does the amount of the order make? Especially after giving me the run-around for two weeks!

So now I have to wait until Monday - it's now Friday - to see if some magical Walmart god is going to deem me worthy of receiving a refund and cancelling the order. UNBELIEVABLE!!

Walmart should truly be ashamed of themselves. After this horrible experience, I'm taking my business elsewhere. Seriously, I'd rather pay a little more elsewhere than be treated like this at Walmart. The time wasted and aggravation isn't worth saving a bit of money.

I didn't realize this until I attended a Justice Institute lecture on rights of Canadians and found out about Walmart, and even Costco

A lot of Canadians don't know that by law, stores cannot check your receipt on your way out of the store If: you paid all the merchandise you bought...

It is different if the alarm goes on and the loud alert siren rings on your way out... If it does not ring and if Walmart or any store can prove you stole something from the store, they can only call the cops but not check your receipts.

Walmart located in Queensborough and that one in New Westminster managed by Pawan Patil violate the privacy of Canadian customers.

Receipts could contain your credit card numbers or debt card numbers.

Also, Walmart has cameras in their tills. Do you know that a camera directed right on your face without your permission is illegal???

Walmart violates rights of Canadians by:

video taping your face as you pay your bills in self-check out counters;
imposing to check your receipts,
hiring a dominant ethnic group only...
allowing managers to impose receipt inspections on your way out of the store, which only the police can do if Walmart has sufficient evidence you stole something.

Worse of all , the dominant ethnic group Walmart employs all come from the community where managers and general managers come from..
There store staff from the ethnic group are unreliable, lazy, full of excuses, arrogant, slow in their physical movements, don't know about computers and pretends they don't carry the product that's displayed in the close cases of their computer stores.

She told me she cannot sent me 3 knifes but I can sent the whole order back. This means repacking each item back in a plastic cover, box etc.  I am currently immobile and unable to do this without great pain. They did not take responsibility that the knifes either went missing at their store or was missed at the manufacturer. No apology either. I felt it was all left to me as a customer to deal with now. I have a walker which had cost me $450 and recently a tire broke off. I received a new walker from the Kenron pharmacy without any problems. The flatware from Walmart was $29 per set.

I find it better to pick up in store than to have it delivered to your house. Shipping costs with Walmart are pretty pricey so unless you’re ordering something that’s over $25 to pick up instore or over $50 to your house than I wouldn’t recommend it. I’ve noticed a lot of random items for sale when searching online. Designer shoes and clothes for high prices. Bulk items for ridiculous amounts of money. I would definitely recommend you stay away from that stuff and stick with something you know you won’t waste your money on. The two times I’ve order from Walmart I purchased toys for my niece and yarn for myself. Both of these orders I had seen instore or research beforehand. There’s no way to tell if something’s authentic or good quality when looking online so it’s safer to just not waste your time on it. If something seems like it’s weird to be sold at Walmart then it’s probably too good to be true.,2019-02-12

Finally after 30 minutes I walked to the store and explain the situation. They paged someone who came and said oh I saw your car but got busy! Then he said come with me I will give you your bags! I told him I have a condition that I cannot carry heavy groceries and that's why I use the service, if I wanted to come to the store, I would have.

https://ca.trustpilot.com/users/5be0b8e25483f4b8a97ac18d,1,Walmart.ca order review,"This review is about the online order process at Walmart.ca. I was looking for a hot-tub cover in a hurry since winter is coming where I live and I fear significant damage if I don't have an insulated cover. Although I had never considered Walmart for this, the website said it was in stock and would be delivered right away - estimate of 2 days. 4 days passed and nothing. As I said, I was in a hurry so I called for an update (their system still said it would be delivered on Oct 29 - 2 days past!). No one there could tell me anything about it but said they would escalate it and I would hear back in 24-48 hours. So, of course, 72 hours later I called back. I was told they couldn't find it but would escalate (again). Last Friday night I got an email from Walmart saying the item was shipped with a same-day courier. It would arrive by Nov 3. It is now the 5th and the tracking number they sent me in the email doesn't work so I called again. They tried to track it but told me the number was invalid - I told them that was why I called them again. They told me they would escalate again. You may be seeing a pattern here. At the time of writing I still don't have the item and don't know if or when I ever will. had Walmart just given me the correct information at any time prior, I would have had time to order another one from a company who could actually deliver it but now it is too late. I'm leaving town in a few days and may not have the cover that I ordered a couple of weeks ago just to be safe. BOTTOM LINE - do not order anything from Walmart.ca if you either need the item of value your time. Just go to Amazon or any one of the many competent companies out there. This has been a disaster from the start. Sorry I ever found the website.",2018-11-05

I feel this is bad customer service and I refuse to use self checkouts because it not only takes jobs away from people but also requires customer to do that work.  The second visit when the express cashier section was closed again, one cashier offered to help me through the self check but wouldn't open the express checkout so I became upset and because I was also short of time but refusing to be forced to use the self checkout, I left an almost full cart of groceries for them to put back on shelves and told the customer service department why.     I have expressed my displeasure with self check systems in the past and have always been told it was just an added option but by purposely closing all the express checkouts they are trying to force customers to use the self checkouts!   Saying it is an option is untrue and it is my opinion that by agreeing to continue to use these self checkouts will only give Walmart more money and employ less people.

Self Check Out Clerk Description: Short lady about 5 feet; dark long hair tied in pony tail; dark skinned.. with heavy accent


I went to Walmart to buy an item, which cost $3.78. Only to find out from the self-check out that it was $7.99. The item was apparently placed on the wrong shelf. I didn’t buy it and called the self check out clerk, to cancel my purchase. She asked me why I didn’t want the item, in a very aggressive way. I told her why. She scolded me and told me next time to check the price before wasting her time. Wasting her time??? I didn’t know you’re wasting your time working at Walmart? Why doesn’t she leave and go somewhere else?

I thought things have changed in Walmart located in 6th St. New Westminster BC. The manager is Pawan Patil. The self- checks out clerks are still rude, rude. Instead of helping people check out, they give you a long lecture on how to operate the cash out machine.

As well, today, a stocking clerk yelled at an old woman who couldn't find the right canned beans. These people are immigrant like most of us Canadians but they think they are powerful just because they know how to stock shelves or operate those check out machines. Shame on you Walmart, for treating old people like pigs.. For selling very salty canned goods, ham and hot dogs for cheap... Shame on you for hiring those immigrants and not teach them manners and how to act like Canadians.

I spoke to one of the staff stocking detergent soap about how the woman was treated and to let the Manager know about the kind of customer service they have in the store. The stocking clerk called Pawan his ""Uncle"".. this is how bad Walmart is when treating Canadians. Pawan Patil and his community of nephews and nieces should be fired from Walmart!!!",2018-10-12

The move to install so many self-checkouts was a bad decision because there is an aging population -- most people are in their late middle age to senior years and they may come to depend on cashiers to ring them through.

I also personally refuse to use the self-checkouts because even if I am relatively tech-savvy, those machines are extremely finicky and difficult to use without assistance.

I was excited at first when they offered home delivery since I don't have a car and carrying everything is painful.

At first, their online delivery service was pretty good but the past few years it's become worse and worse. So has their customer service.

I've experienced:
-poorly packed items (where all the liquid or powder leaked everywhere damaging other items)
-broken, banged up packages
-items missing
-entire shipments missing, even though they claim the package was delivered
-shipments sent to another city even though the address was correct
-customer service reps claiming that they appreciate our service but do nothing to investigate if there is an issue
-customer service reps claiming that they'll email something and they don't
-customer service reps not giving an update (for a week), so I have to call again to find out what's going on
-customer service reps not allowing us to speak with their manager, or not giving us a case #

I've also tried the grocery delivery. Again, the first 2 shipments or so were good. After that, there have been 1 or 2 missing items. One time when I was ill around Christmas and couldn't go shopping, I placed a large order, HALF of the items were missing. They don't include a checklist of the items delivered so I bet they don't scan them. The driver didn't care. He said he can't do anything about it & that I have to contact walmart. It took 2 weeks, a whole bunch of phone calls and emails to get a refund. Who has time for this during the holidays?

Customer service is frustrating. I have to take my heart medication before I call them.

On a recent order, the entire order went missing but I received an email delivery confirmation. When I wrote to them they said it was delivered & instructed me to ask my family members even though that's the first thing I had done when I noticed the package was missing, before contacting walmart, just like anyone with a brain would do. I was angry at that point. That rep didn't even bother to contact Canada post to find out where it was delivered and the website doesn't tag the location. I sent 2 more emails, still no help.
I called them, the 1st rep disconnected me when I asked her for a case #.
I called again, had to go through validation again. That rep didn't help much either.
Finally they gave me a refund... but only for some of the items that are missing. I had to send them another email again.
This is ridiculous.
Now I have to go to the store and buy the items and take a cab home. Thanks for nothing Walmart!

Suggestions:

They need to make sure they package all the items properly (liquids and powders in plastic bags),
that they SCAN all the items going into the box (or grocery bags),
Included a checklist of all the items that are in the package
and that Canada post CONFIRMS that the item is being delivered to the CORRECT address (as per the order), not somewhere in the boonies like one time I was missing a deliver.
I don't like that they are allowed to just drop off the packages on your porche even if nobody is home and claim it was delivered.
I understand if the package is small and can go in your mailbox or is hidden between the glass and wooden door.
Hire people who actually care and will actually try to find out what happened.
When we ask to speak with a manager, put a manager on the phone instead of telling us they care.

I'm really fed up. I wish there was a Canadian equivalent with similar prices.

And I'm also not happy that they're getting rid of checkout staff to install self service counters.",2018-08-20

Half the summer has passed and my kids were still waiting for their Heeleys!!) I asked for a full refund and less there was something they were able to do about it. She put me on hold and came back, to say she would expeditea shipment of the products they had extra in the warehouse, and to expect the shipment by Friday the 10th or latest Tuesday the 14th.

While looking for a cord to secure a patio set I had just purchased from the said store, the fire alarm started blaring throughout the store.  Everyone was instructed to leave their unpaid purchases and to proceed to the nearest exit.  A young lady reinforced this directive and asked me to exit the store.  As I was a few yards from the item I was searching for, I told her that I would be only a few seconds for I wanted to place it next to the chairs I wished to purchase upon my return to the store.  She was very polite when she reiterated the directive.  I was just about to follow her when a young man, dressed in jeans and a t-shirt, sporting a goatee, named David ( it took a lot of effort on my part to gather his name for he was not wearing a name tag and several co-workers  refused to give up his name) rudely chimed in a loud booming voice, ""GET OUT, YOU NEED TO GET OUT OF THE STORE!""  I replied, ""I am putting this down and leaving.""  He got more aggressive and yelled, ""GET OUT!!!!""  I was so upset, I told him that you will not speak to me that way.  He shouted back, ""I DON't CARE!!!""  I instructed him that he was not exhibiting good customer service.  He continued speaking as if I had not just spoken by saying, ""I WILL SPEAK TO YOU ANY WAY I WANT"" and ran off.  I was furious.  I asked the young lady, who witnessed the exchange, for his name.  She seemed reluctant to reveal his identity and said, ""Ignore him, we are almost outside.""  As I neared the front exit, I saw the same young man and asked him for his name.  He answered, ""Why do you need my name?""  I informed him that I had every intention of reporting his unprofessionalism towards a customer (mainly Me).  He stated, ""I will not give you my name.  Give me your name!!!""  So I did (Dina).   I had nothing to hide for my behavior was beyond reproach while he was rude, aggressive and extremely ignorant of the concept of ""providing excellent customer service.""  If WALMART LANGELIER is okay with this behavior, I as a loyal customer, am deeply disappointed in the company's employee screening and training process.",2018-08-17

I ended up going back to the store myself and buying it, paid $20 more than online because the voucher is not for in-store purchases. I can't believe the time that all of this took!!

After talking to 2 different people at Walmart the option given to me was return it to Walmart store.

First review-

I was shopping for this item online and so far this was the best price for I can find with shipping included provided you come up the threshold for tem to ship it free to your door which I did. They did not have this in the store so I can only say that some items are online only. Shipping time was better than amazon without prime and provided you come up the threshold. Customer service on the telephone was great and informative.

Second review-
Chocolate bars
I bought this 7 chocolate bars to get my free shipping from walmart so these were regarded as add on items. My suggestion is though DO NOT BUY perishable items on line especially if they are temperature sensitive. They were all melted and discolored. So they all went to the green bin. I wonder If I brought them to the store, would they have replaced it? So much for online shopping,



REASONS-
Your review cannot be approved because it:
•is vague or needs more detail

Instead, we get an e-mail that they received our request to return the item even though we never requested a return. That e-mail was not an honest mistake. That's a blatant lie to put the responsibility for a lack of delivery on the customer.
Upon contacting Walmart for an explanation, they simply stated that the goods were damaged during transport, confirming the lie in the e-mail. Finally, they promised to contact us again within 24-48 hours which did not happen.

1. As a customer, there is an expectation of goods being delivered. Cancellation of a delivery, which should rarely happen, should definitely not take place over a week after an order has been made.
2. As a customer, you have to thrust the vendor. Walmart has lied about a return request and lied about contacting us to find a solution.

It is clear that their delivery system is broken, with false information sent to customers, and horrible logistics and communication within the company.

https://ca.trustpilot.com/users/5aef581e4de5666d340a5bc7,1,MAJOR MACKENZIE RICHMOND HILL,"Just came back from Walmart at Major Mackenzie & Bayview. Horrible service - which seems to be the NORM for Walmart! Why is this? are employees paid horribly? if so pay them better or something. So the usher in AISLE 16 around 2pm'ish advised me to go to aisle 16.

I indicated or rather asked if I could locate a price checking machine. (Seems they are moved far now!) she told me where to go. I then changed my mind so I went back to her to ask if I can go to aisle 16 now. She LITERALLY did not look at me and said ""well I told you to go there before but then you said..."" I was seriously?? then she realised she was being rude..and tried to 'walk me over'. I then told her WALMART SERVICE SUCKS!..

The last time I was here the cashier told me she wouldn't pack the bags becuase I brought my own bag and that is the policy. WHAT A LOAD OF CROCK.

I'M DONE..and FYI cashiers your JOBS ARE GONE SOON... scan and go, internet of things..robots, AI and basically automation will do SO SO SO MUCH BETTER than your crapshoot of a job.

Both orders were scheduled to arrive on April 25th. On April 25th the bed arrived. No trundle and no mattresses. Call the support line: told that a delivery notification would be sent when it was shipped. received delivery notification April 27th (thinking the order was never placed or sent for shipping until i called).

I ordered a Dylan service for 8 silverware set from Walmart.ca because they only had 1 set in the store by me and my wife really liked the set.  We got the set at our local store, but none of the stores near us had anymore and my wife really wanted a second set so that we would have enough silverware.  After we checked all the local stores we came home and I checked Walmart.ca.  YES!!  They were available.  I ordered a set.  They came in fairly quickly, and when we opened the box it was a Moonstruck service for 8.  We called Walmart, and we were connected to a service representative in the Philippines.  We explained what happened and she apologized, and said if we want to take them back to the local store and replace the order they will give us a 10% discount.  We decided we would give it a try since we had good experiences with ordering from them before.  So I placed another order online with them and took the other ones back.  A few days later the package came in.  Can you guess what it was?  Yep, Moonstruck service for 8 again.  We were both irate at the second screw-up.  We tried calling Walmart.ca, and kept getting a representative in Asia.  We asked them how to speak to a representative in Canada, so that they can explain how they could make the same error twice?  They told us to just hang up and try calling back.  We called back 5 times and every time we were connected to the Philippines.  How can you order from Canada and not be able to speak to a representative from Canada?  I don't get it!!  I guarantee that I will never order from Walmart.ca again.

https://ca.trustpilot.com/users/5ad7d0654de5666d3430a8f2,1,First off,"First off, I would like to say that I've lived my life with integrity, respect, loyalty, and honor. Unfortunately, my (LAST) visit to walmart on 04/17/18 did NOT represent myself as such. I raised my voice and used foul language due to my over-frustration of yet, AGAIN, unacceptable, deplorable, and misrepresentation by walmart Canada. I did apologize for my outburst to the employees and other customers who witnessed my behavior mentioned.
I've been shopping at the Portage La Prairie Manitoba store for 4 years give or take. I've also been to locations in Brandon and Winnipeg MB, Toronto/Barrie/Orillia/Hunstville/Northbay/Timmins/Midland/Wasaga Beach ON and locations across the lower mainland in B.C. I would think this qualifies me as a loyal shopper.
Within the last year, I've noticed a lot of products are being ""slimmed"" down in size while prices continue to climb. Products that are no longer available by walmart, on numerous visits, the ""fresh produce"" has been deplorable at best, certain items are CONSTANTLY out of stock, and, customer service is non existent more often than not.
I generally visit the Portage store 3 or more times a month with receipts totaling over $500.00. And I am just ONE of the MANY Canadians who has been forced financially to rely on ""saving money"". Within the last year, the prices rising at walmart truly haven't saved me ANY MONEY, due to the fact that my income hasn't increased.
So, here's the main point to my complaint on top of everything else I've mentioned above. My visit on 04/17/18 at store #3069 was the VERY LAST time I will EVER darken the doors of ANY walmart outlet. It is right in the middle of tax refund/child tax benefit season at 4:40 pm and, two cashier tills are operating. People are lined up 6 and 8 carts waiting to check out. It took 28 minutes for me to wait and pay for my purchases. ALL of the managers were apparently working the tills in the express check out, therefore, like many times before, no one was available to assist my complaint.
Then, I get the total for my purchases. Six months ago, the same list of products would cost on average $300.00. This time, I was shocked to see a receipt for $486.55. That did NOT include meats, fresh vegetables of ANY type, milk, or eggs. Usually, I would have had at least another 20 items consisting of those, so, I think it's safe to assume that what cost approximately $300.00 six months ago is now well over $550.00.
This is NOT an issue for even a store manager to rectify. It is Upper Management and the Corporation as a whole that is ""sticking it"" to the consumer. You pay your employees NEXT TO NOTHING already, and then leave tills sitting closed to save that NEXT TO NOTHING, all the while jacking up prices CONSTANTLY.
BEYOND DISSATISFIED, AND DISGUSTED WITH YOUR CONDUCT.
HAPPILY AND PROUDLY AN EX walmart SHOPPER/SUPPORTER.
SHAME ON YOU, I PRAY THAT YOU BURN.

This morning I received an email stating I will be REFUNDED??
Reason listed: EXPIRED??
What expired??
Well I guess ""we'll"" never know since they do not believe in real Customer Service & you can not call anyone to figure out what happened, but what I do know is that I hardly shop at Walmart because I try my best to Shop Canadian which is becoming a joke, all the same I wont shop there ever again, can we please keep the American companies out of our home its just not worth it. They don't value their own people/country, so they'll never value us and will only bleed us dry, like they've been doing since Canadian Government bends over for them constantly. So infuriating!!

All I tried to do was make an order for birthday stuff well in advanced for my kid, now I won't have those items.

Now I have to keep an eye on my CC to ensure they actually apply the refund, as I am reading the reviews here & am now wondering if I will get it at all?

I think I'm starting to understand how Walmart truly makes its $. Doing what most Americans do so well steal it from good hard working average people.

https://ca.trustpilot.com/users/5a28dedd0000ff000aed7db7,1,Kid quality guarantee a joke!,"Kid quality guarantee a joke!

I bought my 7 year old special needs son the 3 in 1 jacket for $44.99 plus tax less than 7 weeks ago and not one but both armpits seams blew out horribly.

According to the receipt I have 90 days to get refunded plus the kids quality guarantee gives full replacement until my son out grows it.

I posted a review on their store site and uploaded 3 pics (1 of each armpit and the third their original tags) which was denied as it was deemed inappropriate media. So my opinion doesn't mean anything.

My daughter and myself called to 5 of the walmart stores looking for this jacket as now the website states limited stock. This jacket can't be found any longer in stores. So I contacted the Walmart nearest us and requested to speak to a manager. Request was denied. The lady gave me the number for the corporate office... guess what.., I was given the USA number not canadas.

Frustrated I took my kids out at minus 17 weather with very chilly winds and walked and bussed to walmart to talk to customer service as well as to a floor manager. When we got there we asked to speak with a manager and was told that she was busy with another customer. So we went on the hunt for a new jacket for my son.

The hunt was complete bs. The boys department didn't have the jacket we have in stock. Their was only 4 other styles available (3 didn't fit they were larges and my son's in a medium, and the 4th jacket was half the thickness and came with snow pants) and here's the crappie part.., the 3 large jackets that didn't fit cause they were too tight in the chest area were more expensive then the one I paid for. Disappointed we went back to customer service and requested again to speak to the manager.

10 more minutes waiting and the manager was extremely insensitive, rude and didn't do anything to help us. We were told that they would be only able to refund our money and that we would have to make up the difference if we wanted one of the others. When I explained that the jackets were inappropriate to my son's needs and their selection was less than 1/4th their girls department they told me to get a girls jacket then. Really... putting my special needs son in a girls jacket will get him teased and bullied at school.

We left the store in my son's torn jacket back into the freezing cold for another long walk to the bus then the walk home.

We spent over $28 in transit for the two times we were at their store. Each trip there and back cost us over $7 and again will be spending another $14 this Friday to return this jacket after we buy my son a jacket elsewhere. So in total we will have spent just as much in transit than his jacket.

Very upset about the way we were treated by walmart and upset they couldn't take a few moments of their time to come across a solution that would work for us.",2017-12-07

Hi everyone,  I have just had the worst customer experience I've ever had at Walmart. ca,  and as I promised the supervisor I talked to, I'm not going to just go away! I recently saw an obvious mistake on their website where they advertised a 128gb black web flash drive for the ultra low price of $19.99. Knowing this must be a mistake, but expecting them to uphold the scanning code of practice I went to my local Walmart and asked them to help me with this.  First of all,  I would like to say that the ladies at my local store in Belleville were very helpful!  They dialed the phone number for the online store,  got me through to customer service, and looked up the item in question. The associates and the customer service agent online verified the Blackweb 128gb stick was being advertised for $19.99 and the phone was passed to me. I told the agent on the phone I wanted one but that they needed to change the website quickly to prevent more people from catching this mistake.  She agreed and told me that in order to receive the item for $19.99 I would need to increase the amount of my purchase or I would pay shipping, fine by me, I told her I would order 2 then and she agreed that was acceptable. I waited for these to come in and finally they did, I ran to the post office to pick them up and when I open the box I received a big surprise. Instead of the 2 x 128gigabyte flash drives I was promised I had receive the 32gigabyte ones instead. Slightly miffed about this development I called their customer service again and gave them my ticket number from my first call. Once again the associate I talked to (very politely I might add) promised me the 128 sticks I had ordered.  Just re-order them but give it a couple days for their people to update the item I was told and I would receive my purchases as promised.I did so, again I waited and again I received another 2 32 gigabyte sticks in the mail.  Fast forward to now about 3 weeks later I have spent hours on the phone with customer service, they would not compensate me for my purchase or uphold the scanning code of practice!!!  Since they have now fixed the website they told me they are not going to offer ANYONE compensation who had ordered these items,  and they suggested that if I was unhappy with my purchase I should just take it back to my local store for a refund...... I told this individual,  a supervisor whose name and ID number I now have, I had recorded his calls and wasn't going away till I received what I was promised or adequate compensation for all my wasted time in this incident. He told me that it was Walmart policy to not speak to anyone who recorded them.  Apparently,  it's a one way street where they are the only ones allowed to have a record of the phone calls!!!! Too bad they didn't know I recorded all my personal phone calls a long time ago because I'm sitting on 5 recorded  phone calls of them at this point with 2 different associates both promising me the item I asked for. I wonder if the bad PR I'm about to put all over the internet was worth the couple of items they promised me. Guess we'll find out.",2017-08-25

https://ca.trustpilot.com/users/5962ee5d0000ff000aad5cae,1,Worst retailer in Canada.,"Hi,
I want to lodge my complaint against the Wal-Mart store # 1211. The cashier at the counter put aside stuff from the previous customer due to some reason and the customer left the counter and his stuff because his credit card was not working.
Then I came for checkout and the cashier billed my stuff. He was not sure how to find the price of cantaloupe. He was not even sure whether its cantaloupe or some other fruit. I had to take the bus home. The last bus on that stop at 3:37 pm on July 9th, 2017. I took my receipt and grocery and went to the bus stop, 5 minutes walk with heavy load of grocery on my shoulders. Its o.k. untill then. But at the stop, I checked my receipt and there is 3 extra things, the amount of those 3 things totaled on the receipt and then added to my bill. It was clearly from the previous customer as any idiot could guess because they were totalled first and then added to the individual items I bought from the Wal-Mart and then totalled again included the previous customer bill. I went back to the store, missed my bus, and in the store there were nobody to listen me. The cash counter I dealt with was empty, the customer service people wearing yellow vest and behaving very busy and looking not very approachable told me it was not there fault so they were not ready to listen what I was telling them. The worst Wal-Mart employees I have ever experienced. Do you paying them less than other Wal-Mart stores?
At last I went to the customer service counter. One lady there listened me and then asked what she could do. Seriously? She was asking me whether I took the stuff or not? Whether it was my stuff or not? And at the end when she understood the matter she asked me whether I want my money back? No, I want my money saved in Wal-Mart account, respected lady!
Kindly see through this matter. It was not my fault at all but I missed my bus home and ended up walking 3 kilometers with heavy load of grocery, 2 bags in my hands and one on my shoulder. Not everybody has time to waste due to some reasons peculiar to them. So kindly train your staff properly before leaving them on us customer as an experiment.
Thanks.",2017-07-10

Turns out Walmart uses a company called same day freight to handle their shipping, but it wasn't same day or even same month. After tracking our order and realizing it went to the wrong city then back to the original warehouse we emailed Walmart and called both companies multiple times to try and determine what was happening but the TV's just sat there in the warehouse for 3 more weeks. We sent Walmart another email saying that if we do not receive the order in 2 days we are going to cancel it which is what ended up happening. Walmart then decided to finally contact the shipping company they use and came back to us saying that one of the 4 TV's went missing at the shipping company and that we would not receive a refund until they found it. So apparently Walmart decides that it is the fault of a customer when the shipping company loses an item and the order never even makes it to the customer. So here I am over a month later no TV's, no refund yet. Beware of their ridiculous shipping do not trust it whatsoever and horrible customer service.

The last straw was when I did a big business order of supplies and they didn't send some items. I called and got someone in India with a terrible phone connection, who just kept repeating that it was shipped, and I would have to sign an affidavit saying I didn't receive the items.

I called customer service which is useless - feels like they are goldfish in a bowl. They can't correct card transactions, they don't know when the item will become available AND the TOP of the TOP: They can't cancel my transaction. It means that the item might be available in a month only, but I need to wait for them to ship it for me to return it and once they get it back, they will refund my money. All this time, money is blocked on my card. They were in a hurry to take the amount - 3 times instead of once - but that's the only thing they seem to know how to do.... Will never ever order from this store again. I wrote on their Facebook yesterday - message they hurried to answer to not look bad, but that's all - did not go further than: your complaint was transferred to our tracking department. Major Failure and I will ensure to discourage anyone I know to ever buy their products.",2017-03-23
https://ca.trustpilot.com/users/58d024720000ff000a83a00a,1,Terrible Experience,"Ordered over $600 in storage bins online (32 bins). They sent me 8 bins and said this was the complete order. After 4 phone calls and over an hour on hold (over the time of one month), I learned they had since sold their existing stock and had no idea when they would receive more - that is right, they sold the bins I already paid for to someone else. I was told by 2 separate customer service reps that they would ship me the missing bins - and NO ACTION was taken by these people. 1 month later I'm still without all the bins and my credit card was charged for all the bins over a month ago. They offered no compensation for my trouble except to refund me for the missing items - I required all of these bins to match, now I was forced to keep 8 bins and will have to track down 24 other bins that will not match. Needless to say - I AM NEVER DEALING WITH WALMART AGAIN. I realize problems happen and people make mistakes - but the customer shouldn't be the one to take the hit, it should be the multi-billion dollar company.

There's an older East Indian salesperson at that location named Inderjit who is extremely pushy when it comes to those Walmart Mastercards. Every time I run into her at the store she pressures me into signing up for one of the cards, and is unwilling to accept ""no"" for an answer, and gives me looks like I'm crazy for not signing up for one. I am already in trouble with a credit card company (Capital One) because my life circumstances changed, and I am now on disability and just barely getting by each month, and can no longer afford to pay my monthly fees to Capital One.  Capital One harrassed me big time about the card I had with them. The last thing I need is to make more credit card trouble for myself by signing up for another card.

Meaning my nephew's gifts would be arriving Dec 23-25, when I'd have already left town to see my family. I called Walmart again on the 26th, they just said I'd have to continue to wait. Phoning the 800 number is as useful as a bicycle would be for a fish. So today, Dec 28th, I received an email telling me that one of the items couldn't be sent, so they're cancelling the entire order!! 12 days after my order was supposed to arrive, they only realize now that they don't have an item that, when I placed the order 2 weeks ago, their website said they had in stock??? This has been just about the worst customer service I've ever experienced. Walmart should learn from Amazon.ca how to treat their loyal customers. I never want to shop at Walmart again, low prices or not. Note: I WAS able to reach someone at Walmart by messaging them on Facebook, of all places.

It's great for those who have small orders....but for those of us making a larger purchase, we're waiting forever to be cashed out. Honestly, just another big company that claims it cares about its customers but doesn't. You provide mediocricy in all areas....clothing sucks, shoes okay, food department isn't the most affordable, toys need organization and someone who knows what kids want ordering them, your home sections are all very messy all the time and it sucks when this happens because 90% of the time things are moved and it's difficult to find the right prices or simply the item you are looking for.

That should have no big deal as I have done that for years at that very location, but instead she wanted to kick me out. I had to tell her that I had done this many times which was true so after I was greeted by her with a nasty look on her face. When she gave me a dirty look I came very close to telling her that I do not tolerate people making faces at me. So she hummed and hawed and let me shop. Then when I have sat down on a bench outside the Tim Horton's and started to put my cellphone that I had bought at another store, she started in on me again trying to accuse me of shoplifting. Thankfully I had my receipt for the phone, and she told me that the receipt was from Best Buy and I told not once but three times that that was where I bought the phone from. As long as that o ld badalacks is still employed at this Walmart location I will never ever step foot in there again, because I DO NOT TOLERATE that type of customer harassment by any employee and I HOPE to god that I will never ever get treated like that again.",2016-08-06

When I was about to start shopping I was met with the bitchiest old badalacks for a greeter, I brought in my stuff that I had bought from another store, it was just one bag. That should have no big deal as I have done that for years at that very location, but instead she wanted to kick me out. I had to tell her that I had done this many times which was true so after I was greeted by her with a nasty look on her face. When she gave me a dirty look I came very close to telling her that I do not tolerate people making faces at me. So she hummed and hawed and let me shop. Then when I have sat down on a bench outside the Tim Horton's and started to put my cellphone that I had bought at another store, she started in on me again trying to accuse me of shoplifting. Thankfully I had my receipt for the phone, and she told me that the receipt was from Best Buy and I told not once but three times that that was where I bought the phone from. As long as that o ld badalacks is still employed at this Walmart location I will never ever step foot in there again, because I DO NOT TOLERATE that type of customer harassment by any employee and I HOPE to god that I will never ever get treated like that again.",2016-08-06

When I was about to start shopping I was met with the bitchiest old badalacks for a greeter, I brought in my stuff that I had bought from another store, it was just one bag. That should have no big deal as I have done that for years at that very location, but instead she wanted to kick me out. I had to tell her that I had done this many times which was true so after I was greeted by her with a nasty look on her face. When she gave me a dirty look I came very close to telling her that I do not tolerate people making faces at me. So she hummed and hawed and let me shop. Then when I have sat down on a bench outside the Tim Horton's and started to put my cellphone that I had bought at another store, she started in on me again trying to accuse me of shoplifting. Thankfully I had my receipt for the phone, and she told me that the receipt was from Best Buy and I told not once but three times that that was where I bought the phone from.

The online selection may not be as good as in store but there's still a pretty good variety of items and sometimes there are things in stock online that are unavailable at my local Walmart.

When I was about to start shopping I was met with the bitchiest old badalacks for a greeter, I brought in my stuff that I had bought from another store, it was just one bag. That should have no big deal as I have done that for years at that very location, but instead she wanted to kick me out. I had to tell her that I had done this many times which was true so after I was greeted by her with a nasty look on her face. When she gave me a dirty look I came very close to telling her that I do not tolerate people making faces at me. So she hummed and hawed and let me shop. Then when I have sat down on a bench outside the Tim Horton's and started to put my cellphone that I had bought at another store, she started in on me again trying to accuse me of shoplifting. Thankfully I had my receipt for the phone, and she told me that the receipt was from Best Buy and I told not once but three times that that was where I bought the phone from.

https://ca.trustpilot.com/users/514a5311000064000134f3ae,5,Fast Shipping,I've ordered online from Walmart.ca quite a few times now. Their shipping is usually very fast (and free!) and they have quite a few items available for purchase. The online selection may not be as good as in store but there's still a pretty good variety of items and sometimes there are things in stock online that are unavailable at my local Walmart. Their prices are low as usual and the free shipping with no minimum purchase is a huge plus for me so I'll definitely keep buying here.,2013-03-28

I called customer service to notify them of the roach, and all they said was, ""if you're unhappy with your order, please take the items back for a full refund"". There was no mention of the cockroach or willingness to do anything about it.

I'm a huge fan of the low prices, but it's not worth it for the poor customer service and dirty warehouses. I'm not ordering from walmart.ca again.",2016-09-29

When I was about to start shopping I was met with the bitchiest old badalacks for a greeter, I brought in my stuff that I had bought from another store, it was just one bag. That should have no big deal as I have done that for years at that very location, but instead she wanted to kick me out. I had to tell her that I had done this many times which was true so after I was greeted by her with a nasty look on her face. When she gave me a dirty look I came very close to telling her that I do not tolerate people making faces at me. So she hummed and hawed and let me shop. Then when I have sat down on a bench outside the Tim Horton's and started to put my cellphone that I had bought at another store, she started in on me again trying to accuse me of shoplifting. Thankfully I had my receipt for the phone, and she told me that the receipt was from Best Buy and I told not once but three times that that was where I bought the phone from. As long as that o ld badalacks is still employed at this Walmart location I will never ever step foot in there again, because I DO NOT TOLERATE that type of customer harassment by any employee and I HOPE to god that I will never ever get treated like that again.",2016-08-06

Their shipping is usually very fast (and free!) and they have quite a few items available for purchase. The online selection may not be as good as in store but there's still a pretty good variety of items and sometimes there are things in stock online that are unavailable at my local Walmart. Their prices are low as usual and the free shipping with no minimum purchase is a huge plus for me so I'll definitely keep buying here.,2013-03-28

That should have no big deal as I have done that for years at that very location, but instead she wanted to kick me out. I had to tell her that I had done this many times which was true so after I was greeted by her with a nasty look on her face. When she gave me a dirty look I came very close to telling her that I do not tolerate people making faces at me. So she hummed and hawed and let me shop. Then when I have sat down on a bench outside the Tim Horton's and started to put my cellphone that I had bought at another store, she started in on me again trying to accuse me of shoplifting. Thankfully I had my receipt for the phone, and she told me that the receipt was from Best Buy and I told not once but three times that that was where I bought the phone from.

The online selection may not be as good as in store but there's still a pretty good variety of items and sometimes there are things in stock online that are unavailable at my local Walmart. Their prices are low as usual and the free shipping with no minimum purchase is a huge plus for me so I'll definitely keep buying here.,2013-03-28

That should have no big deal as I have done that for years at that very location, but instead she wanted to kick me out. I had to tell her that I had done this many times which was true so after I was greeted by her with a nasty look on her face. When she gave me a dirty look I came very close to telling her that I do not tolerate people making faces at me. So she hummed and hawed and let me shop. Then when I have sat down on a bench outside the Tim Horton's and started to put my cellphone that I had bought at another store, she started in on me again trying to accuse me of shoplifting. Thankfully I had my receipt for the phone, and she told me that the receipt was from Best Buy and I told not once but three times that that was where I bought the phone from.

That should have no big deal as I have done that for years at that very location, but instead she wanted to kick me out. I had to tell her that I had done this many times which was true so after I was greeted by her with a nasty look on her face.

Then when I have sat down on a bench outside the Tim Horton's and started to put my cellphone that I had bought at another store, she started in on me again trying to accuse me of shoplifting. Thankfully I had my receipt for the phone, and she told me that the receipt was from Best Buy and I told not once but three times that that was where I bought the phone from.
